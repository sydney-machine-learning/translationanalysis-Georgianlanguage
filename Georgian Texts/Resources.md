This is the summary of recourses we can use.

These are all works (poems, stories and one journal article) of the same author: Vazha Pshavela (ვაჟა ფშაველა)   

There are plenty of resources on the internet available in Georgian, but not much in English. But, I guess, this is the reality of low-recourse languages. 
  

I will list what we have, English texts as well as corresponding Georgian original one. Georgian texts can be searched on

Learn Georgian: alphabet and words

([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPtlpQGmg4s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPtlpQGmg4s))

If you want to know how to read Georgian text, try this Youtube video. It is based on famous "დედა ენა" book, created by Iakob Gogebashvili in 1865. This is how I was taught Georgian alphabet at school.

It starts with most frequently used letters ა and ი, and very first sentence you can read is "აი ია" (this is a violet). Then the next letter თ is added, and with these three letters you can read, for example, "ათი თითი" (ten fingers). It's a great book if you want to learn how to read in Georgian.

Book = "Vazha Pshavela: Unveiling Vazha Pshavela: A Dozen Poems by Vazha, with Stories and Artworks Inspired by Him. Translated by Donald Rayfield, with illustrations by Manana Antelidze, Ana Kordzaia-Samadashvili, Andro Semeiko, and Leonid Semeiko. 173 pp. London: Garnett Press, 2018. ISBN 978 0 9564683 4 5" ([https://www.amazon.com.au/Unveiling-Vazha-Pshavela-artworks-inspired/dp/0956468349](https://www.amazon.com.au/Unveiling-Vazha-Pshavela-artworks-inspired/dp/0956468349))

“Unveiling Vazha Pshavela” is initiated by the artist Andro Semeiko and is exploring notions of self and motherland - through landscape, ethnography, and ideas and language of the Georgian poet Vazha Pshavela, who lived at the turn of the 20th century. The book includes three epic poems and nine shorter lyrics by the poet translated by Donald Rayfield OBE. The shorter poems are published in English for the first time. The book contains specially commissioned works by the writer Ana Kordzaia-Samadashvili, the fashion designer Manana Antelidze, and the artist Leonid Semeiko, which are published together with Andro Semeiko’s artworks.

The book is the most comprehensive publication to date of Vazha Pshavela’s poems in English. The selection of the poems in the book illustrates the development of the poet’s humanist ideas and approach to nature that are relevant to ecology and social democracy in the world today. They are accompanied by an introduction by Donald Rayfield, which, together with the works by the others involved, offers several angles for a vision of the poet’s work - bridging his ideas with the present time.

​The book was launched in March 2019 at the Asia House, London, with the support from British Georgian Society and Embassy of Georgia. It has featured at Frankfurt Book Fair and London Book Fair, both in 2019.
