With firm and unbending foot stands the rock, a scowl on its face and angry. 
Thus it stands, unchanging through winter and summer. 
This rock is an entire mountain transformed into rock and stone, face to face with the sky, the sun and, down below, the earth. 
At a casual glance how disgustingly, how unattractively deformed it is, with boulders irregularly and chaotically heaped upon one another; in some places blackened, here and there yellowed, elsewhere blue, scratched, scarred, worn and channelled by heavy rain and mountain-currents. 
But if you gaze up at it and keep on gazing at it, observing it carefully, you’ll see it as a thing of beauty, like a real man who has passed through a thousand wars, cut and wounded by a thousand foes, still looking just as confident, valiant and proud, and still the warrior. 
Perhaps it’s because enemies are legion that it’s necessary to be constantly vigilant, constantly looking in a single direction, with neck strained and tense of face, no doubt because that is the direction from which the foe is expected.
A double ache gnaws at the heart of the rock, one pertaining to the sky, the other to the valley. 
It looks out upon the valley, the rolling meadows, such lovely vistas. 
The valley appear to the mountain like one who has lain down in repose to sleep. 
This is what eats away at the heart of the rock: “Why is it not forever standing on its feet like me? Why is it not vigilant?” 
It curses the valley for its useless riches. 
Yet it also loves the valley, constantly staring into its face; unable to get its fill of the love it feels towards it, it wants to go down to it and embrace it. 
But it cannot but comply with Nature’s immutable laws — it is a rock and cannot move close to the valley. 
Not once does it merit, poor thing, the taste of the sweetness of love. 
This fact merely adds to the numbness and aching in the rock’s heart, but by the same token it has apparently strengthened a thousand fold the love it feels in that heart.. 
How desperately it yearns, poor thing, to pluck just one rose or violet growing on its own beloved breast! 
Gripped by a love for which there is no hope of consummation, it overcomes its hopelessness by regularly asking the eagles, children that the rock itself has reared, for news of the valley, when they, returned from their peregrinations, come and are perched upon its rim…
Ah, you wretched, wretched rock! 
I do understand — I do — your plight and your yearning. 
But you are nevertheless a rock — a rock you will remain — you will never waste away for the simple reason that a rock you are…
Yes, the eagles, sporting around the head of their parent, tell it: “This or that day blood was shed in the valley, or this or that day love revealed its face”…
The rock weeps by night in order that none may see and none may censure. 
Its weeping is greater than that of the heavens. 
Even so, it does not pour forth as many tears as it might — it is afraid of inundating the valley. 
No-one knows this, and therefore you regularly hear them say: “It’s a rock, it’s strong, it knows nothing of weeping, it will never succumb to distress!” 
The mountains listen to the rock’s weeping with heads hung down and don like a helmet the black mist of their black thoughts. 
With tears in its eyes the tall, evergreen mountain-grass, suspended on the rock’s summit, heart-rent hears its mother crying and itself takes up the refrain in muted tones, but its voice is swallowed up by the weeping of the rock. 
The eagles, their hearts untouched by sorrow, learn through the rock’s weeping the essence of that feeling and cover their heads beneath their wings.
The rock is usually the first to welcome the moon, and the moon for its part, as soon as it peers over its head, will murmur to the rock: “Why do you weep, why, my poor friend?”
A tear will fall upon the rock’s face, wash down its bosom and continue downwards with a sob. 
On it goes, bewailing the rock like this: I am the rock’s tear-drop, Mother Nature, product of its misery; the mass of flowers upon your bosom are the product of the moisture I bestow.
The valley also questions the rock, and a tear-drop replies thus: Firm it stands, my sister, as of old, rock-like, as befits a rock, though finally yearning for you has reduced it to these, its customary tears.
Else it is well, whole in head, in breast and foundation.
Imagine a fortress built of lime kneaded with milk coming to the rock — impossible! — even so immovable is the rock with its face looking so morose.
The valley senses the rock’s tear-drop on her bosom, sips it in and assimilates it. 
When the eagles relate this to the rock, it will find a little solace. 
But is it really only the rock which groans and weeps — within its heart someone else, incarcerated in darkness, is groaning. 
An excess of misery has dried up the tears in his eyes, or perchance he has cried so much that he has quite drained his reservoir of tears. 
What has the rock to cry over? 
It can at least see the sky, the sun and the earth, but that living being groans away within its heart, deprived of everything, save torment. 
Bound in thick chains, dejected, his beard is layered with moss, and moss is plastered all over his body too… 
His groans are heard by none but the rock. 
Straight in front of him leans his sword; right there lies his flail. 
Beholding these causes his heart to burst all the more. 
Once upon a time he used to use them, but now he, together with his weaponry, has become prey to rust. 
Day changes into day, night into night — the sun rises and sets, but no respite is afforded to this man.
Century follows on the heels of century, but nowhere is there succour for him, nowhere any release…
Who is there to aid this hero? 
No-one. 
Only one small dog attends to him. 
The whole year through does it unceasingly lick the chain, but, when it is brought to the point of snapping, the smith hammers it on the anvil, and the chain becomes whole once more.
Cheated of hope, Amiran utters a groan — the rock is set in  motion and addresses him thus in an aside: “Do not despair, do not lose hope! 
Surely you see how many storms pass over my brow, and yet I stand firm as ever.”
Of a night the sprites gather at the foot of this rock and sing: It upsets the angels, but we love to witness another’s torment.
May your torture continue, you deserve it!
Why did you interfere with the abode of the ogres?!
You brought a sea of blood down upon them and piled up stacks of corpses.
Your sword was continuously cutting to pieces the ogres’ bodies and the armour on their bodies.
Now get you gone to Daredzhan and to sister Tina.
Since you have not had your fill, Amiran, of groans, implore your whelp to lick and gnaw through the chain; stretch out your hand for your sword…
You who seek goodness for the world, your glory is passed.
Ten thousand times more groan on, you have as yet sighed but little, in such bitterness as this consume all the days of your life!
When the sprites compete this song, a bird the size of a warbler will emerge from the rock, follow the path of light and shriek at them: May God on high bring his wrath upon you through the power of the Holy Trinity, since the torment of Amiran has not enthused you with pity.
Once again you will see Amiran sword in hand, armour on his body;  may he pursue you, may he make you squeal with his own mighty arm!
