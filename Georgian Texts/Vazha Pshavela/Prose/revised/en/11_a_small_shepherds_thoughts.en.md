Wretchedness has been my nurturer, dear brother. 
Ever since I could walk on my own two feet I have lived as someone else’s son. 
When I was seven years-old, my father set me up as labourer to the Didq’ura family, and throughout these past five years he has been using my wages to pay his annual tithe. 
At the end of each year he comes regularly to collect my wages. 
As for me, he’s never even bought me a tiny pen-knife to pare my nails! 
Eh, just let me continue to have living parents, and never mind anything else!
Loneliness has brought me strength: frequently I won’t set my eyes on a soul for up to four months; and what sort of comradeship does old P’ap’ua shew me? 
In the evening I am sometimes actually reluctant to go to the hut — no sooner am I inside than he starts up at me — all the time he’s on at me and cursing under his breath: “Your eyes must be transfixed on the devil and demons, for you simply can’t drive the sheep to decent grassy spots.” 
By the grace of St. George, on these mountains of ours you don’t have to go searching for grass — it’s all around!
My one companion is Q’urshia — he never leaves my side, night or day. 
Even if a new master were to take him over, he would never allow anyone to oppress me! 
One day T’ighuna from the P’ap’ureli family had gone off hunting grouse, having sneaked out of the hay-field away from his father. 
I had just spread the sheep out over a nut-filled plain, when from above I heard: “Tilo, hey, Tilo!”
“Who are you, friend or foe?” I shouted back from down below.
“Well, if you think you’re a real lad, come on up and wrestle me,” was how T’ighuna conceitedly replied. 
I wasn’t afraid of him, and we wrestled. 
T’ighuna was superior in cunning, I in strength — we were equally matched. 
At length he threw me and got me in a head-lock. 
My Q’urshia saw that T’ighuna was no longer joking; he crashed into him and knocked him over, and, had I not gone to his aid, Q’urshia would have torn him limb from limb. 
No dog has yet had the better of my Q’urshia; he’s really proud and confident and won’t let even me get away with it if I upset him without good reason — for a full three days he won’t look me straight in the eyes but goes around with his tail between his  legs to let me see he’s sulking. 
And to cap it all, T’ighuna was wearing an almost brand- new costume and red garters! 
Just imagine me having ordinary white (let alone red) garters for anyone to dirty!
My father’s heart is black as night; I have absolutely no pity for him, but my feelings for my mother have remained tender. 
During these past five years only once has the Didq’ura family grudgingly allowed me a visit home. 
“Would that his mother could swap places with my poor little darling!” my mother would repeat as often as she showered kisses upon me. 
She gave me a pair of multi-coloured socks, and she had also kept to one side for me this shirt with its red centre. 
She plied me with questions about everything in great detail: “How does the Didq’ura family treat you? They don’t beat or starve you, do they? 
Have you been wearing these skins for long, my son?” 
They never treat me any way other than badly, but how could I have spoken ill of them to my mother? 
When she saw my clothes, my hides and shepherd’s felt-cloak all in rags, she began to take issue with my father: “You scoundrel, why did you cast this lad out into others’ hands? 
Why do you let the world get away with killing him?!” — as she said this, large tears the size of nut-kernels began to pour profusely from her eyes and to fill her skirt. 
I too, overcome with self-pity and sorrow, began to cry.
Mother washed my pants, sewed up the rips in my shepherd’s cloak, lubricated my hides and put them back on me. 
It had been a long time since I had eaten bread made of pure wheat; mother baked me a loaf; she borrowed the fine flour from the Molodina family, ‘capped’ it for me in butter and fed it to me. 
The heart was put back into me there at home — I no longer desired to return to the sheep. 
Why — it simply amazes me — has father made me someone else’s son? 
The Didq’ura family will never let me go off to attend a wedding or to worship at a shrine… 
“Your wedding-feast is the sheep,” they’ll say to me. 
The moment my thoughts turn to the games played by women in their yellow frocks, to the merry-making and singing of others of my age, my heart just stops.
The wolf is a horrible stalker. 
Would that I had a pistol if only to shoot at it and scare it off. 
I implored my mother to buy me some powder and shot by exchanging a pullet and to lend me father’s gun. 
She promised she would, but I don’t know whether or not she’ll fulfil her promise.
If I acquire a gun, then I’ll get my own back on the mountain-goats and grouse for teasing me — where I don’t expect it, these goats poke just their horns above the tops of the rocks; sometimes, when massed in a herd, they’ll send an avalanche of sandy material hurtling down, whilst the grouse will raise a flap right before my eyes — yes, they’d better not fool with me when I get my hands on that gun!
While I was at home, our priest’s son, Vaso, paid us a visit. 
He told me that there was plenty of powder and shot in the town; if only he’d brought me some!... 
Ah, would that I too were educated! 
How many things Vaso told me, both those he’d seen with his own eyes and what he himself had heard about. 
Although P’ap’ua had told me this stuff was made of sky and black beeswax, Vaso, when I said this to him, burst out laughing and asked: “Then why hasn’t it melted before now?”
Vaso was handsomely fitted out: a cherkesska of fine material, a variegated cap and silver belt with dagger. 
His father had also bought him a rifle. 
Who’ll be buying me anything? 
When I grow up, I’ll buy myself everything — I’ll have shot and powder a-plenty, a silvery-black rifle, a gold-braided cherkesska…
Vaso gave me one round of powder and shot, but I fired it then and there at a target. 
Vaso’s a kind-hearted lad. 
Had I had with me at that moment the grouse which Q’urshia caught for me yesterday, I’d have presented it to him. 
Why should I want to keep it? 
It will only die on me to no-one’s advantage. 
Although it’s sitting in my basket, P’ap’ua isn’t likely to pay it any heed or give it anything to eat…
Poor creature! 
How its heart was fluttering and beating when I first picked it up. 
A falcon was on its tail. 
I heard a roar like thunder and a swoosh. 
I turned towards it and saw it — in front the grouse, and behind the falcon were approaching at speed. 
Both came close to me. 
At that moment I had the sheep on the edge of a gorge; I was standing beside the water making a reed-pipe of heracleum. 
The terrified grouse could find no further means of escape and fell down into a puddle in front of me. 
My Q’urshia pounced upon it and grabbed hold of it. 
The infuriated falcon wheeled high up into the sky shrieking and was lost to sight. 
I scooped the grouse up. 
Unfortunate creature! 
It was shaking and straining to fly away, flashing its frightened eyes this way and that. 
Last night it seemed more settled; twice I took a peep at it in the light of a birch-torch — it was sitting with eyes closed and its head muffled under its wing.
My mischievous Q’urshia last year did something even more surprising. 
One day I had the sheep on the heights of Apkhusho. 
The grass was soaked from that night’s rain. 
I,  already wet, became even more so. 
The sun had just reddened the tips of the peaks. 
I sat down on top of a rock and was awaiting the sunrise. 
In front of me stood a Caucasian ash… 
Over Raiders’ Gullet there appeared an eagle. 
Full of hubris and pride, it was gliding, only now and again would it bend its neck downwards and from side to side.
Two ravens had swooped up from beneath to attack it and were giving it no peace. 
One of them would shoot past it like lightning, twist back up towards it with its breast facing skywards and screech at it with cawing clamours. 
The eagle deemed the ravens to be beneath his dignity and scorned the attack they had mounted. 
Now and then he would merely beat his outstretched wings and veer to one side. 
One raven was causing him more trouble. 
The eagle in anger struck out with his talon, and the raven with wings outstretched sailed downward; following after was a trail of feathers — one handful of its feathers was caught by the wind and carried up to the sky. 
The eagle paid it no attention but continued as before calmly on his way, casting his eyes over the chasms below. 
The second raven then withdrew. 
The eagle passed over Sadzeriani and was lost my sight.
Then from over Mt.Akhuni a bearded vulture came into view.  
In its talons it held a bone with which it began to play; it hurls it onto the ground and then swoops down after it; then it carries it off — up, up high it goes, releases it from its talons and follows it all the way down again itself. 
It cast this bone down several times and bore it up again.
Shortly it drew close to me but could not see me — I was hidden beneath an ash, and Q’urshia was lying at my side. 
The foot of the mountain above Apkhusho is a rocky- stony place — the bearded vulture tended to keep the bone on the side where the stones lay. 
At this moment some divinity must have gown angry with that vulture, for it cast the bone down near to us. 
Q’urshia darted after it and, before the vulture could snatch it up, reached it first. 
The vulture was infuriated, began hissing like a snake and, quick as a bullet, took cover in the rocks. 
Later I asked P’ap’ua why the vulture was behaving as it did. 
He told me that bearded vultures make a habit of it: “When they can’t split a bone with their beaks in order to lubricate their throats with the marrow, they hurl it down from a height onto pebbles, shatter it in this way and then tuck in to the marrow.” 
Glory to you, o Lord, that birds too should apparently have so much intelligence!... 
My darling mountains, how many wonderful spectacles there are to behold here among you!... 
In the spring, when the avalanches of snow melt away, where the avalanche-falls used to lie, the  campanulas and ferns will spring up; I’ll pick the tender ferns, take them to the shack, and we’ll boil them in milk. 
Can there ever be anything more delicious than that?!
This is lambing-time, when we have baby lambs appearing around us. 
I no longer have time to sleep, day or night, through sheer joy. 
Lambs and ewes together have begun to bleat… 
But, ach! — a further two years to go and the Didq’ura family will permit me to go home, and how could I go back empty-handed to my mother and not take her at least one pelt to be fashioned into a jacket?
