Everyone, including me, adores the lofty mountain, bedecked with greenery and flowers; the smell of spring, the newly risen grass which, having got the better of the recently melted ice, has sprung up stain-free and unharmed and which now gazes upon the sun and the world; it conceals itself and holds its breath in silence, though across its gentle, tender face is spread an indescribable vision of love.
“I am alive again, by the grace of God, my Creator!” it seems to murmur.
What a pleasure it is — the frost on the trees yields to the warmth of spring: some are coming into leaf, others bursting into blossom.
Nothing can compare with the misty, dense, dark, shrouded forest… 
But at this moment I forget everything; in front of my eyes there stands only a single, withered beech.
It too is standing in the dense forest at the head of a crag.
And this crag is covered with a green velvet-like moss.
The other trees stand at a distance from the withered beech, as though purposefully distancing themselves from it and haughtily looking down their noses at it.
Nearby the withered beech have grown up a few clumps of raspberry, their leaves nibbled by roe and buck.
They have extended themselves and peer down into the river, whilst within its roots some liquorice-plants are growing, evergreen throughout both winter and summer, their leaves indented. All trace of life has drained from the withered beech;
a mere three branches are left in the centre beneath its waist — its upper portion has broken off and plunged down the ravine, coming to rest like an improvised bridge. 
Each year only three or four leaves sprout on these three branches, and they are pale, desiccated and yellowed. 
But if you were to look at the other trees, you would see that they stand weighed down with the nourishment that Nature has endowed. 
They count the withered beech a mere nothing and pay it no attention. Only in winter-time when they themselves ares stripped of their wedding-garb and more or less approach a dried up state, coming themselves to resemble the withered beech, only then might they snatch a glance at it (and that obliquely)… 
This occurs just at the moment when the full-faced ‘Mother Goddess’ of the place with her shining visage and flowing locks relates them a tale of love, purity and life by way of a consolation for the realm of Nature. 
Then it is that they jibe the withered beech: “Why are you staring, wretch?! Listen to what Mother is saying!”
The withered beech breathes a deep sigh and, with neither bad nor good grace, refuses to listen to these conceited plants but lends both ears to the tale of the local deity; each of her words pierces its heart like a spear as it quietly pours forth a torrent of tears.
Pitiable beech! 
Time was when it too stood with branches proudly spread; it used to tower high above the other trees and cover the entire forest with its own massive leaves and branches like a shelter.
The eagle passing down from the mountains to the valley used to rest on its top and start to screech in pride. 
But now it resembles someone about to breath his last, ever on the verge of total collapse. 
Here and there the dry bark has peeled off the poor thing’s trunk, and its bare flanks stand revealed. 
At one spot a longer strip of bark has come away and lies dangling down towards the ground — you would think a dagger had been plunged into it and its insides ripped out! 
And it must have a good few worms, for I pass close by it several times and always see a woodpecker perched upon it. 
This cursed bird is forever sitting upon it and, with all the strength it can muster, rapping at it with that damned, accursed beak; all the while it even shrieks and squeals at it, as though hammering home a message of some sort. 
Just look at how many places it has holed out the beech right to the core. 
It’s all set to start grinding out its very heart. 
The beech remains standing, standing unalarmed, with brow unruffled, saying nothing, kind or unkind.
When the wind blows, the other trees rock in response to it — only the withered beech does not move; but in the past, when it was healthy and full of life, at the blowing of the wind it would begin to heave like the sea, its leaves and branches producing claps like thunder! 
The withered beech’s branches used proudly to beat the ground and break upon it. Yes, now the withered beech can no longer respond as of old to the wind like the other trees, can no longer courageously turn its breast to the assault of a storm. 
The withered beech will bend no more, and, if it snaps, what can we say about it?... 
It will crack, come crashing down, lie on its side; its roots will be exposed, raised up towards heaven, as though praying and beseeching God, appealing for help.
In summer-time the withered beech is even more to be pitied
— the other trees are adorned with leaves of green, unharmed and with no thought of grief. 
On them a thousand birds perch to sing; wood-pigeons coo on their branches; the grey warbler strikes out a never-ending song; the rock-bunting fills the surrounds with its shrill whistling as it restlessly flits from branch to branch. With straining neck the roe and buck seek the shade that they afford. 
These leafy trees proudly look down upon the sad, withered beech; it’s an embarrassment to them, and they say: “Would that you were not ruining our beauty!” 
They have no idea that the withered beech is more spoken of than they are — that there are and always will be those who like and love the withered beech, fallen upon misfortune as it is… 
In the village they think of it at least three times a day. Should a father ask his children: “Where did you have the cattle today?”, they will point out the general area around the withered beech.
Word has it in the village that in the rock at the base of the withered beech a leopardess has made a lair and produced a litter.
They say that hunters have seen the tracks of a she-leopard and her cubs around the tree.
Another tells how he cut off from the withered beech the mushroom from which tinder-wicks are made.
In truth, the foolish trees do not know that folk have not yet forgotten the name of the withered beech and still recall its glory.
Is everything that’s withered really to be despised by man?!
A thousand of the living are frequently surpassed a hundred fold by one now dead.
One look at you, deserted one, and a bitter grief lies upon my heart, for I see that you are sad and bereft of protection; 
it’s as if they have struck the alarum, the bell that calls for mourning.
I wish to share with you the woe that has simmered and boiled within my heart for so long, and to feel the stream of tears upon my face.
For what purpose were you born, poor thing, when in death you are not mourned?!
For you there is no death, neither is there redemption!
Who will seal your coffin?
Who will light for you a candle?!
Alas! 
How difficult it is for one to die and for one’s name to disappear forever! 
Perhaps once in a thousand nights an owl will perch upon the withered beech and in a forlorn voice begin her heart-broken cry: “Could you not find it then?”, and, when worn out with crying she hears the reply: “No, no”, the poor creature hangs down her head and in a low voice hoots into her own bosom.
Of a winter a wolf usually visits the withered beech; 
hunched up at it side, he bays, pained with hunger. 
The withered beech stands unperturbed, motionless, uttering nothing in praise or censure; 
it knows neither pity nor hatred; 
its heart boils neither with hostile nor with friendly feelings. 
The withered beech thinks only of itself, the past, the present and future. 
It is as though sorrow has been hammered deep into its heart. 
Occasionally it glances at one small, hoped-for shoot that has sprung up at the far end of a root and which is waiting for the sun and rain in order to grow. 
This alone is its consolation…
