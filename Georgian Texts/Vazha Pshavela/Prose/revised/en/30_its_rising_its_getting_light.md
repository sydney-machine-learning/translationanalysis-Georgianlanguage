Who was saying this? 
Where or when?
It’s night. 
Mountain and valley have been coated with snow; they are so stifled, so much in its grip that the earth’s very bones creak and crack. 
It’s as if Nature lies at rest in her coffin — as if she’s been wrapped up in a shroud. 
Not a sound, not a movement, not the ripple of a mischievous mountain-stream is anywhere to be heard. 
Even the breeze has evidently ceased on purpose so as not to break the all-encompassing stillness, in order not to disturb Nature’s slumber, her repose. 
The forest is layered white with snow; the trees’ trunks and branches are no longer distinguishable… 
Yes, this was the moment when on a clump of hills a pack of wolves was massing. 
Some had arrived early and had to await the others. 
With their howling in the register of a determined base they were informing their comrades: “Come on! Don’t be late!” 
From below, from a village far away an indistinct hullaballoo could be heard; the smoke that had risen from the houses had come to lie upon the village like a pall of mist or fog — it blanketed it; high above, the sky, glowing and studded with stars, but silent and with fixed stare, gazed down upon the earth.
The wolves tonight must pay a visit to the village — such is their thought and intention. 
They were gathering together for the simple reason that they no longer supposed there to be any food in the forest. 
It’s a week that they have been shambling about ravenous — they could no longer even paw the ground for food because of the snow and ice.
They came together; a mighty pack was formed. 
They were all gnashing their teeth — they were hungry, terribly hungry! 
They kept a sharp eye on one another, each longing to observe a mere drop of blood on another’s frame in order that this would give them the excuse to pounce on him and tear their fellow limb from limb. 
But which individual would be satisfied with just a single wolf? 
— they wouldn’t all get even one portion each! 
Maybe not, but they would at least still the pangs of hunger just a little.
It was indeed a sight to be seen — the gathering of the wolves at this time: some were lying on the snow, others had sat down on their haunches, whilst a group were standing with their tails down, but all had their maws open. 
Thus were they debating the question of raiding and marauding.
“It’s a fine time we find ourselves in, lads, a fine time! 
How dark it is! 
Well, whoever has confidence in himself must now put his confidence to the test!” were the words of the old wolf, T’ot’ia.
“Yes, provided, provided,” added another, “that, if we can’t grab anything else, we carry off the dogs at least. 
You know how I operate, don’t you? 
I’ll position you in ambush, then I’ll entice the dog out; by sporting with him, by feigning death under his nose, I’ll cast the proud creature right amongst you, and then you know what job is that you’ll have to do!”
“We’re hardly children that we don’t know how to devour a corpse!” said the others with a laugh. 
They discussed how to break open the sheep’s winter-quarters. 
At the mention of sheep they all opened even wider their maws, lit with fire, and displayed like burning embers their huge fangs. 
They ground and rubbed their teeth together, thereby creating a grating sound, and in their mouths was ignited a general, horrid flame that lit up the immediate neighbourhood. 
They broke up in the hope of a satisfying meal. 
They proceeded downhill, T’ot’ia leading the way. 
They filed along the hill, all in line, with hope aglow in their hearts. 
But just watch how fate betrayed them! 
That which they weren’t expecting occurred: that occurred which always ruined and confounded their enterprise, and it drove them to despair. 
What could this be? 
Their hope lay, did it not, in the darkness? 
But they faintly noticed that in the east the edge of the sky was growing light. 
All bunched together and turned their eyes in that direction. 
After a while the moon peeped out. 
The moon rose and lit up the forest, the mountain, the dark recesses; it lit up the entire morass of darkness.
The wolves, massed in a bunch, were crying out, unable to control their anger: “It’s rising, it’s rising, it’s getting light!” 
The wolves fixed their eyes in the direction of the moon, and from these eyes streamed arrows of disgust, of hatred, of vengeance. 
How they began to curse its appearance!
“A blight on you! May you know the wrath of God! Cursed be you and the day of your creation!” was the chorus of the wolves, gnashing their teeth at it at the same time.
“Ah, would that God would let us get it down into our paws and devour it, that we might bring its life to an end!” 
One old wolf ranted and raved more than all the others.
“Many a time you’ve stung me to the heart,” he intoned. 
“Many a time you’ve brought me to depression, you cursed, you damned orb! 
Many a time you’ve brought me to depression and filled the days of my life with bitterness. 
Many’s the time, having painted red my whole face, paws and breast with the blood of many an animal, I’ve carried for two entire weeks this blood as a decoration and, when catching sight of it upon my body, have quelled the yearning for the days of my youth. 
O moon, would that once I’d sunk my sharp fangs into you too! 
Would that the grey-caparisoned lad T’ot’ia had adorned his shoulders and paws with your blood also!”
The others too were thinking the same, once again with open maws, and had fixed their gaze on the moon. 
But the moon continued remorselessly to rise to its zenith in the sky; it lit up in the forest the roots of the trees and the rocks, the dark ravines; it also lit up in the village the dark recesses of the castle-towers and the ruins of old buildings; it set alight on the black tombstones of the cemetery a candle of its own rays, thereby lending an aspect of grace and life to even the graveyard. 
All hope of booty and marauding was cheated. 
The night is just like the day. 
What on earth are they to do? 
Their hope was dashed, theor expectation lost — they began merely to flash glances at one another; they were pondering, they were picking out which one among them was dispensable and thus to be devoured. 
Each was ready to pounce on the other and disembowel him.
Old T’at’ia, his head and face all swollen, was squatting behind a bush, sunk in thought. 
To him the sight of hunger was not new — he had experienced much misery, but he was not troubled to that same extent for the reason that even now he relied on others to do his hunting; the young wolves used to share their food with him.
“Eh, T’ot’ia, don’t you hear? 
Why’ve you gone all quiet? 
Can’t you see what the situation is? 
We’re perishing of hunger; the race of wolves, all of its kind, is about to vanish from the face of the earth. 
What does your almanac have to say, Uncle?!” said one wolf to him, simultaneously fetching him a blow of the paw to the head.
“Hey, what do you think you’re doing, you brute, you uncouth ass?!” said the old wolf angrily; the other wolves pricked up their ears, sensing the course events were taking. 
“Yes, and what of it?” they all howled in unison. 
“He’s giving you exactly what you deserve; a single paw-blow for an incompetent like you is nowhere near enough. 
Sink your teeth, your teeth into him, lads! This light’s all his fault!” they were all growling.
In a flash they were upon him, tearing at him with both fangs and claws.
“Lads, shew some sense, some reason! What are you doing, you idiots?” groaned T’ot’ia, flashing his teeth now at one, now at another. 
But who would be scared by him baring his teeth? 
In a second T’ot’ia’s life was over — body and soul extinguished together. 
Not a bristle remained anywhere of his much tormented pelt. 
Perhaps you might have noticed the odd blood-stain here and there, and that was it. 
The wolves’ hearts were tempered slightly, but they were still ravenous. 
They looked at one another, each afraid of the other, no doubt because each thought he’d be the pack’s next victim. 
They were afraid and wary. 
As each raced away from the others, much cracking was to be heard in the bushes, much crunching on the snow… 
And the moon came up, sailed high almost to the centre of the heavens, where it sparkled brightly and from where, like a sentinel, it continued to strike alarm into the enemies of the earth… 
The wolves careered any way they could into the forest, continuously mouthing the words: “It’s grown light! It’s grown light!”
