A great rumbling was heard in the meadow surrounded by dense, misty forest. 
Women, men, children and dogs mingled with each other like flies! 
Most of them were people with rifles. 
Everyone's face was beaming with joy and happiness, everyone's lips were smiling;People were turning their heads to a loose bull-deer that had been killed by hunters this morning. 
The child of the forest lay speechless, with the heart of the forest and a pleasant gasp; Eyes, dead eyes, floated in the murky water; The tongue was thrown out.
When the hunter's horses saw the dead deer, they parted with a snort, they turned their backs, they didn't want to fall for the dead deer
so far away, at the end of the field, the sables were grazing on the green. 
The deer didn't like the pods, and now they are on the branches of the antlers.
"Hurry up, hurry up!" shouted the women
let's see how the deer barbecue will taste!"
Someone called out: Come on, women, before the barbecue is consumed, let's breathe the air, get the blood moving, we'll be fitter. 
Well, then - before the barbecue, Daira, Doli and Diplipito!
"It will be very good, better than good," said the man with the big mustache, and he was the first to start tlinking, rushing to Nayalaghar like a bull; 
For the first time, with open arms, he hears the voice of Daire and Diplipito. 
Others followed, spinning on the green, enjoying life. 
Some people are not tired: they are driving deer. 
Killing a deer would put a damper on the fun; Everyone's longed for was fulfilled; They killed a deer, that's why so many people didn't run to the field that they had to kill a deer or a roe deer, and they killed more. 
The departure of the heart is over; Everyone there was happy today. 
Only the forest, the surrounding nature was not happy; The forest was crying, the big slope was crying, the slope of the mountain, which looked down on the meadow, watching the deer. 
Seri, covered with black forest, are sighing, carried by the breeze, blowing the meadow where the bull-deer rested.
The venerable trees - lindens, oaks, lindens, beech trees, poplars, beeches, birches, yews, etc., were shocked, they all heard together, although they were standing far from each other, the death of their beloved son. 
The forest is the deer's mother, the forest nursed the breast, the cradle was supported by the forest, and the forest covered it with a blanket. 
The forest rejoiced and admired the bull-deer, it pleased the forest that it had raised such a handsome, beautiful child.
The beauty of the forest itself was woven into the beauty of the deer. 
Siturfe deer is a proof of the beauty of the forest.
Ulazato, can the ugliness hide the beauty? 
The deer saw the forest itself. 
A deer is a forest animal. 
Well, tell me - the forest, where even a deer's eyes and mouth could reach, if he spared it?! 
The impassable forest was possessed by the deer as a complete property; The forest was happy about this, when it was sad: it wanted its son, brought up, to become a beautiful, kind, wise and strong, famous man.
The kindness of the deer was the kindness of the forest itself, as the kindness of the child is always the glory of the parent.
Wow, my beauty, 
wow, to me! 
Light would shine in my heart when he would walk past me and shine his beautiful, innocent eyes on me - said a rock in the forest covered with green and yellow moss, tangled with oak and beech roots.
The deer, the companions of the slain, who wept 
and fled in fear, had their own lives to worry about. 
In the forest, even if a thrush licks it, it seems like death to them. 
They blink their eyes here and there, they prick their ears, they sharpen their hearing. 
They smell the breeze; The smell of a human scares you more than a wolf...
The forest was crying...
In the north of the Didron oak, the table was spread long, the edges of the table were decorated with flowers for the gathered people - men and women. 
There was eating and drinking, a great feast, the clinking of glasses was heard for many hours. 
The singing was followed by dancing and laughter.
The sun set to the west; The evening was approaching; The hunters will prepare to go home; Women are packed in carts; The boys are riding horses. 
As far as possible, the guns were hung in a crooked manner; Every time they met, they would say the following without saying a word: 
"We are game killers, very right-handed rifle shooters, and that's why, boys"!
Return home hunters satisfied, happy.
The field was left desolate, above it there was only a burnt area, where a fire was roaring an hour ago, and a deer barbecue built on wooden skewers was burning on it; Where a long table was spread and the laughter of men and women was heard. 
Here and there were the protruding bones of deer, human teeth, and the remains of dogs.
And the forest cried and said: "Wah, my illustrious son, Borjav, when will I raise a child with yours, adorned with a horn and a body; I was proud of you, and who will I be proud of after today?!"
The forest said to him, shedding tears at the same time.
