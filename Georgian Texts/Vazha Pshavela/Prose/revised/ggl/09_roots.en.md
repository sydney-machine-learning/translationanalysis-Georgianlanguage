Don't be afraid, we are not snakes. 
What does the snake want on this high mountain? 
Don't panic, we won't harm a man, we won't poison him.
That wrinkled, dry skin surrounds us from the outside, did that scare you? 
At one time we had a different color and look. 
Time, the circumstances of the times have changed our face, and now, whether a shepherd or a hunter stumbles upon us, he must be frightened, until he sees us up close, until he realizes that we are the dry roots of one oak tree and nothing else. 
Once upon a time, we used to feed a huge oak tree, we fed it, we nursed it. 
With our sweat, with our efforts, the oak hummed smugly. 
We also liked ourselves that we raised a beautiful, heartless, proud child.
You and your oak want my effort, my love, Earth has told us many times; But we still begged for food for our lover's son on our knees. 
For his sake, we had day and night.
Let's not reduce food, let's try - we encouraged each other with these words
rest, Earth, rest. 
We won't bother you anymore. 
For whom we caressed and begged you, we don't have him anymore, we are also withering, why does a dry and dead person need food? 
A man, an unforgiving person, killed our hearts, killed our children and left us with tears in our eyes. 
He got up and started cutting with an ax; He did not understand the moaning of us and our son. 
When they beat us with an ax, we groan, and you, men, call it "raccoon".
Blood pours out of us and you call our blood "tree juice"... 
If we don't take out our hands, we don't scratch anyone's head and mouth, we don't curse, we don't follow those who leave and we don't meet those who come with an angry face, why don't we feel anything?!
"I'm cutting an oak", - the man called his comrade, pretending that nothing happened. 
He couldn't see that we were silently shedding tears in the ground, that our sin-guilt made the earth cry too. 
Or who am I praying for 
who is the giver of thanks!..‚Äù
Although the earth was saying this, at the same time it was laying the roots of the beech, birch and poplar that came forward, growing from afar... 
No one, blessed by God, can say no to this. 
She is everyone's mother, she cares for everyone, she supports everyone. 
May your breast be blessed, our mother, our nurturer, our suckler!
But what will Sabralo do? 
Fate denied me that too. 
Yesterday and today we cried a lot, we regret leaving the place where we were born and brought up, where we felt life.
Who knows what lies ahead?! 
Day by day our apartment is falling apart, falling apart, and we are left homeless, homeless and hungry. 
At the end, we will stop and go down, we will go down into a deep ravine.
Who knows what awaits us there? 
Who knows what soil will meet us there? 
Will we die completely if the earth will cover us and give us food?!
Who knows, maybe a raging river will drive us to a desert place, and the hot rays of the sun will burn us, destroy us, and erase our memory!
God, do not lose us!
Bedo, don't lie to us. 
Earth, give us another apartment! 
We are thirsty for life and work
we want to work more, we want to raise a child on our roots, we want to feel joy again. 
Forces of nature, have mercy on the mudara of the pitiful roots.
