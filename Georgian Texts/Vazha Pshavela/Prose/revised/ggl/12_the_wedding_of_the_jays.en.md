This story happened in a big, black, cloudy forest, far away from villages and towns. 
what's the story you will ask.
I will tell you about Chhikkta's wedding. 
Chkhikvi Zakara wrote a cross on the beautiful, famous for its turf and extremely devilish Chkhikvi Ketevani.
These two young birds were crucified by the venerable Chikhikvi Thomas.
Thomas earnestly raised his eyes to the sky and said: "Bless, Lord, this crown, inspire love and loyalty among them, let them multiply, like fish in the water, stars in the sky, they are called the unruly Saretsel, your servant Zacharas, and Mkhevli, your Ketevan." 
Amen." After saying this, he placed a crown of turf flowers on both of their heads. 
"Amen!" "Amen!" - a crowning voice was heard from here and there. This was called by the birds that were invited as guests: warblers, cherons, shrikes, nibbles, cockatoos, gnolls, fence-climbers, fireflies, warblers, warblers, tradni and many others. 
There was no more capacity, as many guests gathered. 
The flowers were also happy, they were invited to the wedding. 
Cold, Ankara water was coming out there. 
The table was laid long and there were thousands of foods and delicacies on it.
What would you say to a worm and a fly, don't bring them here - a thousand grass seeds...
The Nephew-Queen was invited to the throne covered with flowers and the guests also sat down in a row. 
There was a great feast and feast. A thousand kinds of drinks were served: Kakhuri ruby ​​wine came to the table like water...
Everyone toasted Nefe-Queen and everyone gave gifts.
A woodpecker was sitting on one of the stalks in a hole nearby, and he called out "Mraval-zamieri".
Hey, you shout at me, you don't drink wine, son, and what will happen? Drink wine, sister! the birds called the woodpecker in unison.
Wait, men, give me a little time, God bless you: I found a big fat worm here, I want to dig it up and then drink as much wine as you want, I don't have to worry anymore, I will be calm
the woodpecker answered them and started pecking at the future tree with his beak. 
Everyone turned their eyes to Kodala.
Well, you know and your bravery, called the woodpecker birds. 
If you don't take it out, woe to your skin, you won't eat bread again, you know.
For a long time, the woodpecker's beak and feet were rubbing on the future tree, and not for nothing: the woodpecker dragged out a good elongated worm, similar to a snake's worm, and served it to the Nephew-Queen with its beak.
Long live Nefe and the Queen! shouted the woodpecker in a high-pitched voice. 
Long live the campaign!
Long live, long live! Hooray! Come on, woodpecker! 
Barakala, do not be ashamed of yourself and neither of us, the birds screamed. 
Tamada "Sakgqmo", because the woodpecker showed bravery, provided a booth full of wine; He also hit her without hesitation and threw her into Tamada's empty stall. They boldly chose the same teacher Chkhikvi Thomas.
They eat bread and drink wine, but do not sing. said the crow and called the table in his beautiful voice. 
The crow was given a ban from here and there, and he sang so loudly that the forest rattled. The mountain was roaring. 
The flowers are dying with laughter. 
Near here, one mouse had a sorority. 
At the noise, he stopped and looked out of the sorority. 
He gazed for a long time at the flight of birds, he looked at the fat, nutritious food, colorful, various, and greedily swallowed saliva after saliva. 
He waited for a long time and couldn't wait any longer
let him say whatever he wants; He slunk close, scooped up and scooped up the nuts on the table right in front of Nefe-Queen.
Whoever comes, long live! Long live the grumbler! the general sound of birds was heard.
Yes, it's your trouble to look at us, boy! said the frightened birds to the mouse.
May the Lord bless you, bless you, change you, live and be happy, always be happy and don't let the Lord who gave birth disturb you
said the mouse, while munching on one hearty nut, gnawing it slowly with his teeth.
Give wine to Zrutsuna, wine, shouted Tamada
there is a lot missing from our knowledge.
I didn't drink wine for you, I changed it for you, I prefer nuts to the light of my eyes, you spent time; I squeeze the nuts, nothing happens.
I don't know what the answer is! Yes, drink, otherwise we will pour wine on your head, Tamada said aggressively to the mouse and handed the booth to the woodpecker.
The woodpecker grabbed Thomas's booth and sat down near Krutsuna.
Drink, brother, it's a wedding, isn't it! Nuts, what an order! Hey, if you're tired too, hey, bring down the booth
said the woodpecker and gave him the booth.
I can't drink, if you're a brother, leave me alone, I can't and what can I do, what can I fall into the water
the mouse answered him and turned his mouth away.
Pour it, pour it on the head of that virishvili, maga! shouted Tamada, 
so you shouldn't toast Nefe-queen, you idiot!?
I don't drink wine in my day, men, now you have to make me drink wine?! How will it be, what a whim anyway!? You are honest people from Darbais. 
Here's one for the toast of the Nephew-Queen.
Drink, drink that Razbonic
he must drink by force 
he can't. 
Why was he here, if he didn't drink wine
drink, drink, the sound of birds could be heard.
The woodpecker patted Krutsuna's neck with one hand, and with the other hand he put a bottle full of wine in his mouth and began to drink forcefully.
If it's your will, I know you won't eat it, sir, but it's Tamadi's will here. 
You look at Amodona Dunya, there is no one, she should not drink wine here, one you appeared here on a whim. 
Ha, dare, dare, it's not a sin to avoid wine like mother's milk, you're not afraid, are you?
The mouse swallowed a few drops with its paws and grunted, it seemed that it did not like the wine.
Dare, grumbler, dare! Well and yes! Embrace, embrace! 
Oh, bye, boy! - The birds are chasing the mouse.
The mouse squealed, stretched the strings of his throat, fought with the wine and poured it out. 
And he poured a little wine on the velvet cup.
Don't pour wine on the kulaja, cherchetto, doesn't it look like your khachan's pie that you act like a fool?! Kodala attacked. 
Then he sighed deeply. 
He was missing the last sip and shouted: Long live Nefe and the queen! 
Long live, Ejibo, your nephew!
Long live, long live! Mozala, Mozala! an enthusiastic voice was heard.
Soon, Trusuna was filled with wine and followed by bayats.
He sang so loud that everyone's ears were pierced. 
Then he started dancing. 
He killed people with laughter. 
The magpie followed him, and they both looked away. 
The crows were holding their bellies with their hands, so many people were laughing at this picture.
Oh, I'm tired, said the mouse at last.
It really spread to the mouth and chest. He lay down near the table. He raised the bulging bird to the sky and screamed.
At the very end, a nightingale was sitting on the table; The singing bird did not sing
did not laugh, He looked at Seir thoughtfully.
Beautiful nightingale, why don't you make us hear your beautiful voice? they asked the nightingale about the birds.
The nightingale refused; "Am I always in the mood for a song, I'm going crazy," he said.
As it was, the begging-mudara of the birds stopped and the nightingale also started. 
The sound of the birds died down, the flight of flies was heard, the soul was refreshed by the flower, and the eyes of the horse were startled. 
The nightingale sang:
Glory to you, Lord of the heavens,Glory to you, force of nature,Glory, Crowned King, And toast to you too, bride!
I wear a crown when I'm in love, I will embroider the sheath with virtue,
I won't regret it, I'll weave it into everyone, If I find something good in the world.
And the one who is full of heart, That's what I'll do to you, man and woman.
love is my heart, If I saw someone else's, I'd be surprised.
Today, your passion is the greatest. And thus captures our heart and eye.
At this time, a bull-deer would appear from far and near and would listen intently to the singing of birds and the whistling of nightingales. The whistling of the nightingale stirred bile in his heart. 
He thought of something, tears came to his eyes, he sighed and turned to hide in the dense forest.
The birds sang together. 
Everyone sings the same song, and each sings in their own voice. 
This song praised nature, the grace of the forest and the earth.
The birds are grateful for this grace. At that time, an eagle passed by with the eyes of the eye.
"Eagle!" "Eagle!" a voice rang out: "The king is coming!" 
All at once their tongues fell into their stomachs, they no longer dared to utter a voice; Everyone shuddered and trembled.
At that time, the eagle was really and terrible to see: what did he want? 
He didn't need more than one to turn the crowd of birds into a complete mess.
Why did you get together, people? turn off your voice. Is the king trying to capture us? said the teacher who was chirping with birds.
if you tell me, I will invite the king here this minute.
Some refused; Who can resist the brilliance of his eyes? 
They said: we can't please anyone anymore and what will happen. Others liked to invite us.
Master Chkhikvi went skating and played in front of the king of birds.
The eagle did not stop walking, as if a fly was flying ahead.
Long live your majesty, our king, the hooded chickadee saluted the eagle.
Long live Chkhikvi too, he said in a dingy voice.
Our majestic king, please visit us at the wedding.
please with heart and soul; I beseech thee, all thy congregation, kneeling down.
If your majesty befalls us, we will be very proud of you, we will surround ourselves with you.
Maybe why! said the eagle. Push me forward!
The bird flew down and the eagle folded its powerful wings and landed. 
This image was like a sky monster.
The whole flock of birds broke up and squawked before their king. 
The eagle also gave a special salute to the group of birds.
They invited the king and put him in charge. 
They all stood up wearing hats. 
The nightingale was not seen only here.
You can sit down, the eagle told them, and the birds arranged themselves according to the rule of seniority and juniority.
This story happened on Monday. 
People who went to the forest, whether for work or hunting, were surprised. 
Everyone said: what is this story, what made the birds so that not even one of them could be heard from anywhere.
What did the people know, if the birds were at the wedding of the chicks, in revelry and feasting.
The eagle was served wine with booths. He drank unharmed, and made merry
cried some heroic song in his terrible voice, All of them felt a tingling sensation in their bodies.
God, everyone begged God, - God, don't make our king angry with anything, otherwise he will destroy us in a second.
The eagle did not care, he asked the birds to have fun, to sing, to dance
but the birds somehow changed their mood. 
Don't know what happened to them. 
To give courage to the birds, the eagle ordered them to blow the horn.
The command was carried out at the same moment, and the eagle began to roar with its powerful claws: it almost completely trampled the flowery place.
Still, no one dared to play. At the end, Krutsuna dared to complain again: it was so loud, so loud that the dust reached the sky.
Once, he even jumped on the head of an enraged and enraged eagle. 
The king was not a little offended by such a foolish behavior of the servant, but due to politeness and the occasion, he did not say anything to him
he only provoked him once so that the mouse almost died from fear.
However, after this upheaval, he was no longer fit for a grumbling man, he became ill, went and lay down at the foot of a tree. A dry poplar leaf was put on top.
Among the birds, the woodpecker behaved most boldly. 
It was also well-kept, and it was so strong that the whole mountain-bar was shaking. 
The woodpecker became so bold that even the king was pleased.
Who gave you the kingdom, he said to the eagle. When did we choose you?
Boy, you family man, shut up, what are you talking about, you brat? the birds whispered.
I won't keep quiet either! Why should I be silent, my dear?!.. said the horrified woodpecker again.
What kind of people are you? You are beating everyone in your heart, my son, but you are not saying anything in your mouth. Boyhood is personal.
The eagle laughed a lot at the whims of the woodpecker, but insulting the king of the birds, Ithakile, they caught the woodpecker, put a nut in its beak and tied it to a tree nearby. 
The woodpecker got tired, he doesn't make a sound anymore. He does not understand why he was punished so cruelly.
If the birds were in this attraction, the fox would have stolen them. 
The clever animal watched for a long time from the edge of the forest and tried the time, thinking, first they get well drunk, then it's my time. 
At that time, they saw that the fox had bitten his mouth for the nephew-queen. 
There was a sound, a scream, a chorus of birds broke up, and a beaked eagle chased the fox, and for a second, he lost his soul. 
The birds scattered: some sat on the trees, others flew high. 
Let the eagle and the woodpecker stay down.The sick mouse also looked for the soro at the sound of the alarm. 
The eagle also freed the woodpecker and said: I have forgiven you, because you were drunk, and then don't dare again, otherwise, woe to your skin.
Each one took off, flew up, as if clinging to the sky, and began to spin around there.
Ketevan and Zakara also took shelter in the dense forest: they spent that day hugging and kissing each other, and in the evening they slept side by side on the beech branch of the other.
