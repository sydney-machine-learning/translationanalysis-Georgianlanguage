It was summer. 
The mountain was turning green. 
Snow could be seen on the peaks above, and avalanches in the valleys below.
The shepherds herded their sheep and cows in the mountains for the summer, but as luck would have it: a plague broke out, the stray sheep and cows suffocated and died. 
You can't catch up anymore; Many streams of water were filled with blood. 
On the avalanches in the ravines, around the apartments and fences, there was a thicket of snow. 
The long-awaited time for birds and game has arrived
huge ravens, jays, orbs, crows and ravens were fluttering; The greedy, covered with carrion, were sitting on the nearby rocks, carrying blood with their legs and wings, and they were bleeding on the rocks, the street, and the streets.
One greedy savi was sitting on top of a rock. 
He could barely breathe in his greed, but he would roll his eyes more bravely and stop greedily at the pile of carrion in the abyss.
Kha, kha, kha! - he said with a laugh at the end, - look, well, look at that fool, that wretch, that worm, that bastard! 
I wish that at least one bite would come out and then he would say something bad about me, then I would move on. 
God shame me, weigh us on the scale, brother, if I don't weigh two thousand nightingales. 
If I fall into the air, I will spread my shoulders aside, even a thousand versidas will see me with the human eye, and if you don't lower your head, you won't even be able to see it with your eyes;
No one has seen the pilot, it turns out that he moves in the jags and bards and mutters something and is praised for that. 
It turns out that I was sleeping with my eyes closed. 
They are not even equal to my eyes, which never close and keep me always ready for food and food. 
And he is whining and whining, he doesn't even think about food and drink, and at the same time he curses me...
"Qraant, Qraant"! - It was heard. A black raven was walking towards Swavi. 
First, he playfully played with the sitting savi, and flapped his wing on his wing, he wanted to throw him up, but when he couldn't move the savi, weighed down by his greed, he landed next to him and sat down on a rock.
Crow, crow! - Savi turned to the raven and began to ask him with his midriff: - How is he? What did you say about the nightingale that day, did it sing beautifully? 
Would you like to turn me into a nightingale too?! 
Utkuov, Utkunov!
Yes, I'm telling you the same thing I told you: I will never forget his singing in my life, and you won't believe it, I'd rather hear his singing than even that pile of carrion.
How was it, how was it? Tell me! - asked Savi again.
He sang beautifully, beautifully! 
How many times have I been greedy for carrion, the meat of various animals or birds, I have never experienced such pleasure in my life.
And then, when I listened to the nightingale's song, my heart began to beat, I could clearly hear its heartbeat. He didn't get up all night, he didn't rest. 
There was a whole swamp and that.
What did you want in the swamp at night? said Savi with a smile.
A carcass would appear in Minam Mt. 
Before God, I met many people. 
I got tired of going to the mountains and spent one night in a swamp on a huge bog. 
That night I heard something that I have never heard in my life and I will still appreciate hearing the nightingale's voice. 
I will go tonight too, I'm not hungry anymore and nothing. 
I will go, sit on the same bed and listen to you, and I will visit you here in the morning. 
On the same tree, on another branch, a crow was sitting. 
Although it was thoughtless, he would translate his own words; 
I only liked the sound, I didn't understand the words. 
The crow knew the nightingale's language well and would translate it in detail. 
Don't you know, winter and summer go to Barada and you could easily study it.
What did he translate for you, why don't you tell me too? said Svav again.
Many things, who can count! I couldn't learn them all, the raven told him.
I remember a few things. 
This is what the nightingale sings: "Get up, flowers, beauties, turfans, angels of the earth, you have been chased like a wolf, you have changed." 
May God not give me one day's life without you, my life is yours, yours. 
Forest, crown of the earth, always be happy with leaves and fruits, always be green, always be blooming and I, your poor master, will sing to you, praise your peace, your creator. 
Let your innocence not be disturbed by any sin, so that you don't cry bitterly, don't break my heart!
"Source, holy, Ankara river! 
Nature flows like milk to quench the thirst of all animals, to water the plants prepared to grow, to make them happy, to make them happy, to raise their heads; 
Do not forget, your pestilence, the last worm, the last worm, because it also longs for life. 
Don't be afraid: keep going, keep going. 
When I see you, a holy feeling and great love twinkle in my heart like yours. 
Lord, God, bless the spring, bless the flowers, bless the forest, I worship your grace and glory!
"Sun, consolation of the essence of everyone, warm, make everyone happy with your gracious rays, and don't burn, don't burn, don't spoil the right hand of man and nature; You, breezy sky, save the sun, mix together and sow grace on the country! 
All the forces of nature, gather with me, listen to my voice: here the villages, here the huts, there the orphans, the homeless, the homeless are crying. 
Help me, make the crying laugh, feed the hungry, with your power and grace!.. 
Ah, Sabralon! 
How many are crying
how many are crying
and their tears are flowing in my heart like the sea, they hug my soul, they ground my life.
"How many shepherds cry 
and their food is torn away by ravens and ravens, unlike, ungrateful, ugly birds, feeding on other people's tears, gnawing on other people's graves. 
The memory of that hurts and poisons me." 
and more and more.
What? Are you sweet and raven? Svav said furiously
Because of this sun, Svav and the raven are alone and bright, like that, they wander alone and cannot enjoy the pleasures of this world. 
What a pity that you didn't pay immediately and get rid of that scumbag, that ugly thing!
Would I have talked so much about myself if I had been there?! 
Wouldn't my life then be on my head if I didn't immediately tear it in half?
If he had said it so directly in dry words, I would have done the same thing, but he said it so beautifully and gracefully that I was exhausted, my claws stuck to the tree trunk, my beak was exhausted, he enslaved me, made me weak. 
I'm sure that if you were my friend, you wouldn't have raised your voice, you wouldn't have moved the crint. 
I didn't tear myself apart, I have to go there tonight and listen to the nightingale sing again, and if you want, you can come too. 
You threw that shit out. 
It is easy to kill him, to catch him. He sings blindfolded all the time; In the morning I saw one of them, he closed his eyes and said the same thing.
I will go, said Svav, and I will lower it today, I will show you its progress.
Let's see, follow me, then let's go! - said the raven. 
"Karaaant", it was heard, the raven took off
and the crow flew with it, and they took off together.
Dusk fell, when both, the raven and the raven, fell into the big ditch, on the side of the big one.
It was a good night. 
The raven, wide-eyed, hoarse, impatiently waited for the nightingale to swoop. 
Unlike Sva, he lowered his chinchakh, curled his beak, spread his shoulders, and lay like a white sack on the branch of the beech tree.
Why doesn't he sing, where the hell has he gone, Okheri? - said Svav for the last time
at least yell at him to raise his voice.
Wait a little longer, wait, answered the raven 
if I scream, what will I hear, and who knows, he will sing by force?!.
Some time passed and then they heard something like a moaning sound.
Well, well, it's started, it's started! - said the happy raven
pay attention, it is Isa, singing, it has started, well now you know how to get rid of the beast!
The moan was followed by a cry, first slowly, slowly, softly, and finally a divine voice rose.
Svav raised his head and opened his eyes. 
appeared. 
Midnight brought. 
The nightingale was singing and singing, "Oh, oh, oh," she cried, "it's really, really touching my heart, raven!"
It dawned, the twilight mingled with the light, the raven stared at Sva and noticed that two tears were gathering in the eyes of the raven.
Well, uncle, what are you going to do
kill him if you can
why are you running away, are you silent? said the raven smugly.
I went into my thoughts, I was carried away by my thoughts. 
I don't want any more promises.
I told you, you can't do anything, I said.
do you remember?
I remember and I didn't lie to you either, said Svav with a sigh.
It would be noon when the crow and the raven sit side by side in the ravine and peck at the carcass.
