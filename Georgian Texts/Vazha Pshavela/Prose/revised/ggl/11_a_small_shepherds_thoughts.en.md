I was brought up in poverty, brother. 
For him, as long as I can walk, I am someone else's child. 
When I was seven years old, my father made me a guardian of the Great Qur'an, and during these five years, my father has been paying the mahta instead of me.
At the end of the year, he comes to collect my money.
He didn't even buy me a single knife. 
Oh, I wish my parents would bring me alive and what would we do!..
Loneliness gave me strength: often four months would pass, I would not see a man with my eyes; Old Papuan, what kind of friendship will I have?
Even coming to the apartment in the evening, sometimes I'm too lazy, he immediately starts yelling at me, yelling, "You look like a devil, you can't beat a sheep in grassy places." 
We don't want to look for grass in our mountains, thanks to the cross of Lashar!
My inseparable companion day and night is in my ear. 
Let him change his master to Kurshiya, he will not oppress me! 
That day, Papurelt Tighuna was hunting grouse, my father was robbed by a mower. 
He was a sheep I laid on a plain of nuts, Zevida heard my voice - "Tilo, yes, Tilo"!
Who are you, enemy or friend? - Kvevida called me.
"Well, if you are a boy, come up, wrestler", Tighuna told me with self-satisfaction. 
I was not afraid either, we wrestled. 
Tiguna was better with a saw, I was better with effort, "straight". 
Finally, he turned me around and grabbed me by the throat. 
My Kurshia saw that Tiguna was no longer joking, pushed him, pushed him and, if I didn't help him, he would have been torn to pieces. 
My corner has not yet been bitten by a dog; He is proud and big-hearted, he won't let me down if I beat him up for no reason, he won't look at me with Kheirian's eyes again in three days, he said.
The fur was cut off, Tiguna's new coat and red boots almost didn't wrap around him. 
Who will make me black, I won't say red, but they will give white?
My father is a man with a dark heart, I don't blame him at all, I changed my mother again in my soul. 
These five were barely invited to the Didkurant Shina once a year. 
My mother was very happy to see me, she kissed me for a long time: "May my mother be my mother", she would say as many times as she kissed me. 
My mother gave me a pair of colorful socks; He had saved this red heart shirt for me too.
He asked me everything in detail: How are they treating you, Didikuraani? 
Do they beat you, or do you not care?
Has it been a long time, son, since you wore this leather? 
Sometimes they treat me badly, but how could I say bad things to my mother. 
When my mother saw my clothes, torn leather and fabric, she started a fight with my father: "Why did you put this bag in someone else's hand
why are you investigating the country?!" - she said this, with tears of the size of a hazelnut heart falling from her eyes and filling her skirt. 
I heard too, shook my head and started crying.
My mother washed my underwear, sewed a cloth for me, oiled my skin and put it on me like that.
For a long time, I didn't eat Tsminda's bread anymore, and my mother baked a cube for me, borrowed Tsminda's flour from the waiting people, "closed" me in an erbo and fed it to me.
My heart returned home, I didn't want to go to the sheep anymore.
I wonder why I follow my father as someone else's son? 
They will not send me the Great Quran once at a wedding, not even in an icon... 
Your wedding is a sheep, they say. 
I will remember the play of women in red dresses, the sound of my legs, the song and my heart will die...
The wolf suffers terribly.
I wish I had a knife to open it up and open it. 
You blackmailed my mother, bought me some bullets and medicine, and asked my father for a Dambacha. 
He promised me, but I don't know if he will fulfill his promise or not. 
If I find a deer, I will throw away the feathers of the grouses and grouses, if they don't attack me now and, where I don't think, the grouses will raise their horns on the top of the rock, sometimes they will rock an avalanche of sand, and the grouses will take out their feathers in front of me - well, don't attack me then!
During my stay at home, the son of our priest Vaso came. 
He told me that there is a lot of ammunition and drugs in the city. I wish he had given me...
Ah, I wish I was educated too! 
Vaso told me how many things he had seen and heard. 
However, Papua told me that the sky is Dindglisa, but Vaso, when I told him this, started to laugh, why didn't he melt here.
Vaso was dressed beautifully: a moudi chokha, a colorful akhalukh, a silver belt and dagger.
Father bought the gun.
Who will buy me what?! 
When I grow up, I'll buy everything for myself: I'll have a bullet-medicine block, a shy rifle, a Sirmian chokha...
Vaso gave me one shot of ammunition, but I burned it there as a sign. 
Vaso has a good heart. 
Then, if I had the grouse that my kurshia caught for me yesterday, I would give it to Vaso. 
What do I want
I will die in vain
Although it goes into the basket, Papua does not listen to it, does not feed anything...
Pity!
How he was bursting, how his heart was beating, when I first took him in my hand
Shawarden was following him. 
When I heard a thundering sound, I turned my head and saw
a grouse in front and a shawarden behind are coming
Both of them approached me
the sheep was leading me to Kobtkhevi, I was sitting on the edge of the water and I was making a dike stew. 
The frightened grouse could no longer find his way, he fell into the puddle in front of me
He got into my ear and caught it. 
Shawarden broke down, went up and down screaming and died in the sky. 
I took the grouse in my hand. 
pitiful! 
He trembled and tried to fly away, he was looking here and there with his torn eyes; 
Last night, he seemed to be more at ease, he was sitting with his eyes closed and his eyes closed.
My cousin did something more surprising last year.
Once a sheep was led by Apkhusho's tails. 
The grass was wet from the current rain. 
I, already wet, got wetter. 
It was the sun that reddened the mountain tops. 
I sat on top of one of the rocks and watched the sunrise. 
A cicada stood in front of me... 
an eagle appeared in the throat of the thief
He would be proud of himself; Only from time to time he bent his head down and back and forth
Then two ravens sowed and did not rest
One of them would be alarmed, turn around loudly and shout "Kharant", "Kharant".
The eagle did not respect the ravens, it did not bypass their attacks
He occasionally sprinkled only his shoulders and advanced on one side. 
One raven was more concerned. 
The eagle swooped down, hit the gas; The raven came up with its wings spread out, followed by a trail of feathers, and the wind carried away the raven in one fell swoop. 
The eagle didn't listen to that, he was still walking to himself and watching the gaps. 
The second raven then stepped back. 
The eagle passed through the ground, I lost sight of it.
Now Akhunida appeared one orb. 
He held a bone in his claws; The orb played with the bone: it will drop to the earth and it will be placed; The mayor will take it again. He will go, he will go up, he will let go with his claws and he will come down with him
Ese dropped the bone several times and took it away. 
Soon he also came near me, but he could not see me, the ear was covering me, and it was lying on the side of my ear. 
Apkhusho's tails are rocky, the orb was more rocky than the bone. 
Then God was pleased and an orb dropped a bone close to us, put it in his ear
and while he was about to pick up the orb, Kurshia was able to pick it up. 
The orb was offended, began to hiss like a snake, and rushed into the rocks like a gunshot. 
Then I asked Papua: Why was it hurting, my Papav, what is the orb? Orb knows that
Iman told me: when he can't break a bone with his beak to rub the brain with his throat, he will drop the bone with a rock, crush it, and then destroy the brain. 
Praise be to you, God, even a bird had such intelligence!.. 
Your mountains, mountains, how many things are good to see here!.. 
In the spring, when the avalanches melt, kenkesha and chaduna will appear in the fields, I will pick the Norch chaduna, bring it to the apartment, boil it in milk. 
Could there be anything more delicious than that?!
Drumming is also at this time, we have lambs. 
Day and night I no longer sleep with joy. 
Let the lambs and the mothers of the lambs cry... 
But, ah! After these two years, they asked me for a big Quran at home, and how could I come to my mother empty-handed if I didn't bring at least one book?
