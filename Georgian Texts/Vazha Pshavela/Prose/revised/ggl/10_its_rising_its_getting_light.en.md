Who said that? 
where or when
it's night
The mountain was covered with snow It is so tightly bound that the bones of the earth shake.
Nature seems to lie in a coffin, wrapped in sudara. 
No sound, no movement, no gurgling of the teal mountain stream can be heard anywhere. 
Even the breeze is stopped by the Ganges, so as not to disturb the peace around, not to disturb nature's sleep and rest. 
The forest is covered with snow, the trees have lost their trunks and branches... 
At that time, a pack of wolves was gathering on one Kurum hill. 
Some came earlier and were waiting for others.
With a howl, in the voice of Nelly Bokh, they announced to their comrades: "Come, don't be late!".
An indistinct rumbling could be heard from the far village. The fog that came out of the houses spread over the village like a fog, covered it like a blanket, the sky was full of stars, and it stopped at the earth, full of tears.
The wolves are to visit the village tonight. This is their thinking and intention. 
They gathered together because there was nothing left to eat in the forest. 
For a week, the hungry people have been living in Dallas, they can't even dig the ground for food because of the snow and ice. 
A big pile was collected. 
Everyone grinds their teeth. They were hungry, very hungry! 
They looked at each other and looked at each other, one of them noticed at least one drop of blood on the other's body, so that they would have proof of that and tear their fellow man bite by bite. 
Which one was shared by one wolf
they wouldn't even get one bite!
No, you will at least kill the hunger pangs a little.
An important sight was the gathering of wolves at that time: some were lying on the snow, others were limping, and a row was standing with their tails down, and all of them had their mouths open. 
That's how Taresh talks about the hike.
It's been a good time, okay, guys! 
How dark! 
Well, those who hope for themselves should try now, - said the old wolf Totia.
Even so, said the other, if we can't throw anyone else out, let's take the dogs at least. 
Do you know my story? 
You will ambush you, I will lie, I will play, I will die to death, I will throw you on top, and then you know how you will win!
We children don't know how to eat carrion, the others said with a laugh. 
They are planning to break the fence. 
At the memory of the sheep, everyone opened their red, burning lashes and showed their teeth like skeletons. They picked him up, bit by bit: his teeth gnashed and the common, terrible fire lit up, lit up everywhere.
They broke down in the hope that they would be able to escape
they fell down, they led a branch in front of them
they put a stick on the mouth of the mountain - they went down, they had hope in their hearts
but they saw that the fate was against them. 
Whatever you don't expect, it happened
What happened was that their work was deteriorating, falling apart It's been a year. 
What happened to this? 
They were hoping for darkness
but little did they notice that the edge of the sky was shining in the east. 
They all grouped together and turned their eyes towards it.
After a while, the moon pulled out its beard. 
The moon rose and illuminated the forest, the mountain, the dark hills; lit up Jurghmuli. 
Grouped wolves shouted angrily: "It rises, it rises, it shines!" 
The arrows of contempt, hatred, blood-seeking were shot from the eyes of the wolves, which were directed towards the moon. 
How they curse his rising!
They broke your leg, cut off God! Woe to you, woe to you on the day of your birth! Wolves say, gnashing their teeth
"Oh, I wish he had thrown us into his hands and eaten us, so that he would give us life for him." 
One old wolf was the one who was most anxious and barking.
You broke my heart many times. He said
you have made me sick many times, you cursed, you pretender
You have made me tired many times, made my days of life bitter. 
I painted my nose, mouth, branches and chest many times with the blood of many animals; For two whole weeks I will be adorned with this blood, and the sight of it on my body will kill me with thirst. 
I wish, moon, that I once gnawed my sharp tooth for you
and that I could decorate the cheekbones and fingers of the legchokha boy Totia with your blood.
The others are also thinking the same thing, still looking at the moon and stopping
the moon was rising higher and higher, it rose higher in the sky; He lit up the bottoms of trees and rocks in the forest, dark ravines, and also lit up the dark corners of the castle towers and ruins of ancient buildings in the countryside; Even the cemetery looked graceful and alive. 
Every hope of giving birth was disappointed. 
The scale of the day is night. 
what are you doing 
They gave up hope, lost hope, started looking at each other; You think, you choose, who among us is expendable, edible. 
One was ready to push the other and tear it in half.
Old Totia was sitting behind Jag with his head down, lost in thought
He had seen many famines and experienced many misfortunes, but he was not bothered because of that, he was still hunting with the hope of others; Young wolves share that food.
Totiav, hey, don't you understand?! 
What are you doing, 
can't you see what's going on?
We are dying of hunger, the kinship of the llama wolf, the jilag should be cut off from the mouth of the country.
What does your carabadin write, uncle? one wolf said to him and shook a branch at his head.
What have you been doing, you fool, you big donkey?  said the old wolf with a scowl. The other wolves also pricked their ears, sensing the situation.
So what?! Everyone roared together
You're doing very well, it's not enough to play a single branch on your fool.
Give me a tooth, a tooth; This light is all my fault! Hello everyone. 
They didn't let go for a long time and they saved their paws too...
Boy, cleverly, cleverly! What have you done, you fools? Totia grunted and gnashed her teeth sometimes on one, sometimes on the other
but who would be scared by that gnashing? 
Totia's life ended in one second; His soul died along with the corpse. 
The fur was no longer on the skin of the long-suffering man. 
If you noticed a little bleeding somewhere, it was him. 
The wolves calmed down a little, but they were still hungry. 
They looked at each other, one of them was afraid of the other, probably because now I won't be eaten. 
They were afraid and afraid. 
One was running away from the other, there was a rustling in the trees and the falling of snow... 
And the moon rose, it floated high, almost in the middle of the sky, it shone brightly and from there, like a watchman, it warned the country of the enemy...
And the wolves ran without a trace in the forest, and everyone said: " It's lit up, it's lit up!".
