I have never committed any sin in my life. No living creature, or even inanimate
object, will ever be able to name any sin or evil deed of mine. Thus have I been appointed
by God — I am destined to flow and flow; everyone is to quench their thirst through me.
On a hot summer’s day how many hunters come and drink my waters? How many weary
and exhausted workers will come and bring their scythes or sickles to sharpen? Men
drink, and is there one in a thousand who ever says: “God bless you, cold mountain-
spring! What wine can ever be compared to you?!”? Most of them spit on me! What can I
do? I can’t spit on anyone. Go on, let them continue spitting on me! How fortunate, God,
I feel myself to be! What good friends I have at my side! Look here; first there are these
boulders, covered thick with green moss; then again, over here, there’s this yellow-faced
rock, nestling, as it were, above my head and gazing down at me — I wear it on my head
like a helmet. These spirit-like maples, how they’ve shot up to the sky and don’t allow a
single ray of the sun to reach me! Their thick roots, twisted like snakes, they’ve sunk
deep into my bosom. For a distance of a mere two or three versts I am fortunate and free
of blame. Then the monstrous river drinks me up and absorbs me; my name, my own
identity is then lost. It forces me to sport at its whim, while itself it howls, rages, clashes
hither and thither, destroys the earth, tears up and drags away the trees, involving me also
in these crimes. But at that stage I am no longer what I am now at this moment when I
first burst into life out of the boulder. Oh, I’m terrified of this river! How many times do I
hear thereabouts folk flapping around agitatedly: “Someone’s drowning, help him! Isn’t
there a Christian among you?!” And a portion of the blame rests on me. Woe is me! 
Would that I had not been so appointed by the Creator and might have flowed on and
on unceasingly, watering plants, the beautiful heart of the earth, quenching the thirst of
both man and beast! How happy I feel when I flow down amongst the butter-burs that are
all about to wither, and they bow their heads to me, salute me and simultaneously weave
for me a dress of their leaves. Then when I ripple down among the fern-beds, and they
surround me and lovingly call to me: “Greetings to the mountain-spring, greetings!” Now
I’ll soften the dried up roots of the hazels and viburnums, squashed in a rock-fall, and
give them the chance to look up at heaven again!... O God, why do you permit that
empty, boring, inconstant, restless river to ruin my good work?! Last night what a
horrible dream I had!... God who gave us birth! Lord! Protector! Be kind to me!... I
seemed to see myself perishing. A drought, a severe drought had set in. The grass, the
trees, our parents, had withered; I too had all but dried up. A pretty, fluffy-chested beech-
warbler flew down from a poplar-branch, wanting to bathe in one of my puddles but
could no longer wet its wings and began to weep. As I watched this, my heart began to
break: “Where will you go, my little fried?” I murmured. The withered yarrow and
milfoil, the reeds, the birch, lime and viburnum — all, all as one were a-fluster: “Let’s get
some water to aid the spring! We mustn’t let it dry up!” They began offering me each a
drop from their leaves, branches and roots, but they couldn’t help me. At the same time it
was as if the earth swallowed me up and I should have perished in the bottomless abyss! I
grew frightened and suddenly woke up. My heart was beating fast, sweat had poured out
over my forehead. I looked up — the ravines had become congested with mists. the
maple folded its branches over me, rocked my cradle and murmured to me: “Don’t be
afraid, little one, you won’t dry up, you won’t be lost!” At this moment, a beautifully
headed deer, with antlers spread out across his back, by day ever alert and on the look-
out, suddenly appeared, thirstily bent down to my crystal-clear water, drank and satisfied
his need. Then, with a tranquil heart, I proclaimed: “I am not dried up, I am not!”
