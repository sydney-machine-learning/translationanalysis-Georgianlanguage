Don’t be afraid — we’re not snakes! What would a snake be doing up here on this
lofty mountain?! Your momentary alarm was groundless — we do man no harm; we
shan’t poison him. Was it our outer covering of dry, wrinkled skin that frightened you? 
At one time we had a different colour and air about us altogether. Time, the onward
march of the seasons has changed our appearance, and now, if a shepherd or hunter
stumbles upon me, he must suffer a pang of dread, until he sees me at close quarters and
perceives that we are the dry roots of a single oak and nothing more. At one time we used
to feed a mighty oak; we provided it with nourishment; we gave it suck. It was thanks to
our sweat, thanks to our good offices that the oak proudly used to hold its head up high.
And we too were pleased with ourselves for having raised a beautiful, proud child with
such an unbending heart.
“You and your oak had need of my strength and caring attention, mind!” the earth has
said to us on many an occasion; but we nevertheless on bended knees and with the hands
of a supplicant would beseech nourishment of her for our favourite child. For his sake we
observed no difference between night and day. “Let us try not to deprive him of
nourishment,” we used to say to each other in encouragement. Rest, earth, rest. We shall
now trouble you no longer. We no longer have him for whom we used to flatter and
entreat you; we too are drying up — what need of sustenance have the withered and the
dead? Man, unpitying mankind, tore out our heart, murdered our child and left us to shed
tears. He set to and began to chop at him with an axe, hearing neither our nor our child’s
groans. When they strike us with an axe, we groan, and you, men, call this the axe’s
‘thud’. Our blood seeps out, and the name you give to our bood is ‘tree-sap’… Simply
because we won’t raise our arms in self-defence, because we don’t scratch anyone’s face,
because we don’t abuse anyone, because we don’t pursue the departed and don’t greet the
newcomer with anger written across our face, for that reason do you really suppose that
we feel nothing? “I’m chopping down an oak,” the man was calling out to his friends, as
though it were nothing. He could not see that we were even then silently shedding tears
onto the earth, and that our misery had started the earth crying too: “Unhappy wretches,”
she groaned, “for what, for whom did you torment yourselves? Or I — for whom am I
tormenting myself? Who has any thanks to offer?...”
Even though the earth was expressing these sentiments, nevertheless at that same time
she was putting out food for the beech-, birch- and poplar-roots stretched out in front or
grown up at a distance… Blessed of God, she will never be able to refuse anyone. She’s 
the mother of everyone; she cares for all; all are suspended upon her back. Blessed be 
your breast, mother of ours, you who nourish us and give us suck!
But what’s she to do, poor soul? Fate has cheated her too. Yesterday and today we did
a lot of crying; we regret our separation from that spot where we were born, grew up and
felt the rhythms of life. Who knows what awaits us?! Every day our abode suffers more
destruction and disintegration; the gully is extending its domain, and we are left without a
roof over our heads, bare and hungry. In the end we too shall crumble away, sink
downwards and descend into the gloomy ravine. Who knows what awaits us there? Who
knows what sort of soil will greet us there? Shall we perish utterly, or will perhaps the
earth cover us up again and make food for us?! Who knows — perhaps the crazy river
will cast us up somewhere at a deserted place where the rays of the burning sun will
wither us, dessicate us and extinguish all memory of us.
God, don’t let us disappear! Fate, don’t cheat us! Earth, create again for us an abode!
We thirst for life and toil. We want to labour again; perhaps again we shall rear upon our
roots a child; perhaps again we shall feel joy. O forces of Nature, grant this supplication
of pitiable roots!
