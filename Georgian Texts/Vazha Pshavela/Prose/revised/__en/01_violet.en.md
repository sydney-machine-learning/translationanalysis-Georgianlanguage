I have sprung to life in a dense forest… While I live, with my beauty I shall bring
sweetness to the forest, the grass and that rock which gazes over from across the river,
with its bosom clothed in moss; I shall spread my delightful aroma all around. I am loved
by all; just here that rotting tree-stump has its eye constantly fixed on me; it laughs in my
direction and wants to come over — to kiss me, but it can’t; only from a distance will it
continue to laugh and smile at me, poor thing; it may be ugly, but in general there will
always be a wealth of kind-heartedness depicted on its face. 
And do you think it’s only that stump which rejoices in my existence? The trees too
with their dry, beard-like foliage joyfully look down on me from above — themselves
bare-headed, they cover me with their branches: “Our little violet mustn’t catch cold;
nothing must upset her,” they say. The cascading rain they don’t allow to fall directly
upon me, for in a moment the rain can strip me of my leaves, and leaflessness means
death for me. No, the trees — birch, beech, the nut, wild pear and elder guard me on all
sides; droplets of rain on their branches they hold and then slowly sprinkle on my face,
just two or three, to produce a dew-like effect, and thus bathe my face for me. I gracefully
bend my neck and yearn that I could only sing and that he who gave me life had endowed
me with the talent to praise on high the sky and clouds, the sun, these trees that protect
me, these mountains, those groves and fluffy-chested birds who hop about amongst the
withered, yellow leaves with their red and green plumage and from time to time chirp
right in my face; they embolden me and themselves rejoice in my being alive. My single
month’s existence betters another’s two-year span; nevertheless a long life is indeed the
object of my desires. This morning a beech-warbler sang away close by me — it was a
thing of beauty, red-necked and fluffy-chested; it too, just like me, took pride in itself as
it looked over its breast and shoulders; everything takes pride in itself, everything enjoys
life, everything loves nature.
Yesterday there was thunder in the heavens; but thunder and lightning cause us no fear
— thunder portends rain, and rain, after all, gives us suck at the breast of Mother Earth.
The sun is a father who looks down on us from above, caresses us and keeps a watchful
eye over us. Plants rejoice at the coming of rain — they rejoice and are full to
overflowing with joy. Shortly they’ll be donning new dresses and jackets. Look, it’s two
days since my companion, the foxglove, sprang up; she rejoices, she rejoices, poor thing,
forever shaking her head, now way down low, now way up high, now bowing to the
earth, now saluting the sunshine; she whispers to me and tells me tales about life and
love. Now and again she’ll even let forth a peel of laughter, embrace me and kiss me.
Yesterday morning both of us, my companion and I, wept.
How pitiless is man?! Whatever he sees, he wants to use for his own advantage.
Probably he can’t properly evaluate our beauty! In front of us there passed a man — on
one shoulder lay an axe, over the other hung a rifle. He approached a magnificent beech 
with its branches spread all around, laid into it with the axe and brought it tumbling
down. The pitiable thing let out a moan as it fell. Beyond us a wild peony had sprung up
and had not yet risen clear of the dry, fallen leaves. When the tree crashed down, the
peony shook off her covering of leaves and shone forth in a blaze of red — her heart
sank, and tears welled up in it.
At midday a tired and exhausted pigeon came, perched in front of us on an elm-branch
and began to coo. It also rejoiced in the coming of spring and in the fact that once more it
saw a familiar location where all was at peace. Suddenly, a gun went off; the pigeon
ceased cooing, for a moment held on to the branch with one foot then fell to the ground,
landing in front of me. Blood trickled from its beak, and it closed it eyes; the blood which
had spilled out settled in spots on the leaves. This sent a shiver through me and the
foxglove… I hear nothing distinctly now; only some kind of heaving, rumbling and dull
hullaballoo is all that I perceive…
Alas, how wretched is the violet,
sprung to life on the mountain-side!
Poor thing, she is frozen by the cold
and struck about the head by lightning.
God has given to the wretch
a short period of life;
the adornment she brings to the world
is but a pitiful moment long.
When the violet’s death approached,
she sobs out: “Alas!
Lord, if thou bestowed life on me,
why didst thou not grant me a long one?”
