They stood and waited. 
The mountains' waiting is boundless, as boundless as the sea that lies in their hearts. A red, blood-like clot throbs in their chests. 
Outwardly, on their faces, nothing is visible except hostility. 
This is also a sign of anticipation. 
Who knows what's happening in the hearts of the mountains, what fire is boiling and overflowing.
Mountains, mountains! 
What do you expect, who do you expect? 
Do you have a beloved you haven't seen for a long time? 
Maybe you lost a child? 
Maybe you have a brother, or a mother who has gone far away, and you haven't heard from them? 
There is no answer. 
They stand unwaveringly. 
They wait, they wait, and they will wait again. 
What will quench the sea of anticipation in their hearts? 
It has no end, no conclusion, like a deity...
When all souls, insects, grass, flowers, the river, and the restless, tireless breeze fall asleep, then, only then, they will sigh and shed tears. 
We, humans, then say: Ah, what a heavy, stone-like grief weighs on my heart.
Why don't you sing, mountains?! 
Must I die without hearing your voice, your song! 
Why don't you laugh? 
At least show me your smile, please! 
How could one thought have subdued, captured, and tamed you, suppressing all other power and signs of life in your heart and mind?! 
No, no. Sometimes you rejoice too, and the world thinks you feel nothing. 
I know candles are lit in your hearts when a playful eagle dances above you and descends to rest on your lap. 
How beautiful you are then! 
How it suits you that your raised child is so brave, persistent, and beautiful. 
It is your messenger, telling God your story...
Don't you have thoughts? Ideas? Feelings? 
Don't you dream? 
Of course, you do! 
What are those beautiful flowers that adorn your chest? 
That's your dream, your hope, your comfort. 
Why do you cover yourselves with frequent mists if you're not quietly thinking about something and hiding those thoughts from us humans?! 
Why do you grow grass? 
Why do you create cold springs? 
Why do you unleash avalanches? 
Why do you raise playful oxen and goats? 
Who are you fooling, you good ones!
They stand and wait. 
Rain falls on their heads, lightning strikes their golden peaks, fog plays with their eyes, and often pierces their chests like an arrow. 
It's nothing. 
Half a mountain often collapses and slides into the valley as an avalanche. 
It's nothing, as long as the rocks and boulders still wait. 
Go, those who don't want to be with us up high, close to the sky, rest below.
It snows. 
It freezes. 
It's cold. 
The stone cracks. 
The mountains are wrapped in a shroud, as if they were dead. 
Bury us, mourn us, they call to us. 
And we expect them to bury us...
They stand and wait. 
Their hearts ache, they ache a lot. 
But they don't die, they don't get sick. 
They wait, for whom? Or what? 
Something. Yes, something. 
This something is seeing the unseen. 
They have seen and finished what their eyes and hearts could reach. 
Their eyes and hearts yearn for something new.
Is this not the insatiability of the eyes and heart? 
It is exactly that.
