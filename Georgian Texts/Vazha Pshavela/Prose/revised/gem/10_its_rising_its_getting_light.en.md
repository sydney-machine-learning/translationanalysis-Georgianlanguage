Who was saying this? Where or when? It's night. The mountains and valleys are covered in snow; everything is so frozen, so tightly bound, that the Earth's bones creak and crackle. Nature seems to be lying in a coffin, wrapped in a shroud. There is no sound, no movement, not even the murmur of the mischievous mountain stream can be heard. Even the breeze has intentionally stopped, so as not to disturb the peace, not to interrupt nature's sleep and rest. The forest is buried in snow, the trees' trunks and branches are no longer visible... At this time, a pack of wolves was gathering on a hill in a thicket. Some had arrived earlier and were waiting for the others. With howls and deep, slow voices, they announced to their comrades: "Come, don't be late!"
From below, far away from the village, an indistinct murmur could be heard. Smoke rising from the houses had spread like a mist, a fog, over the village, covering it like a blanket, while above, the sky was ablaze, studded with stars, gazing down at the Earth, tight-lipped and astonished.
The wolves were going to visit the village tonight. - That was their thought and intention. They were gathering together because there was nothing left for them to eat in the forest. For a week they had been wandering around hungry, unable to even dig in the ground for food because of the snow and ice. They gathered, forming a large pack. All of them were baring their teeth. They were hungry, very hungry! They looked at each other and hoped to see even a single drop of blood on each other's bodies, so they would have an excuse to attack and tear their fellow wolves to pieces. Who would be satisfied with just one wolf, when each one would hardly get a single bite! No, at least they would quench their hunger a little.
The gathering of the wolves at this time was a remarkable sight: some were lying in the snow, others were curled up, some were standing on their feet with their tails down, and all of them had their mouths open. They were discussing their raid, their campaign.
"Good times have passed, good times, boys! How dark it is! Now, whoever has hope in himself must try," said the old wolf Totia.
"Just let us, just let us," said another, "if we can't catch anything else outside, at least let's snatch the dogs. You know my story? You ambush them, I'll lure them out, I'll play with them, I'll run up and down the slope, I'll throw them at you, and then you know what to do!"
"As if we don't know how to eat carrion," said the others with laughter. They were discussing breaking into the sheepfold. At the thought of sheep, all of them opened their mouths wider, revealing their large teeth like embers. They snapped, they clashed their teeth: the teeth sparked and ignited into a common, terrible fire, illuminating the surroundings.
They dispersed with the hope of being fed, they descended the hill, led by Totia, they formed a line at the edge of the hill - they lined up, hope awakening in their hearts, but alas, fate had betrayed them. What they didn't expect happened; something happened that would ruin their plan, destroy it; their year had turned. What happened? They had hoped for darkness, but they noticed that the eastern sky was brightening. They all gathered together and turned their eyes in that direction. A little later, the moon peeked out. The moon rose and illuminated the forest, the mountains, the dark corners; it illuminated the ravine. The gathered wolves, filled with anger, exclaimed: "It's rising, it's rising, it's getting brighter!" Arrows of disgust, hatred, and bloodlust shot from the wolves' eyes towards the moon. How they cursed its rising!
"May your feet be broken, may God destroy you! Woe to you, woe to the day you were born!" said the wolves, gnashing their teeth: "Oh, if only we could get our hands on you, devour you, to end your life for this." An old female wolf was the most resentful and furious.
"You've broken my heart many times," she said, "you've saddened me many times, you cursed, you damned; you've saddened me many times, you've embittered the days of my life. Many times I've stained my nose, mouth, paws, and chest with the blood of many animals; for two whole weeks I've adorned myself with this blood, and the sight of it on my body quenches my thirst for killing. Oh, moon, if only I could sink my sharp teeth into you once, if only I could adorn my shoulders and fingers with your blood, like the brave young Totia."
The rest of them thought the same,still baring their teeth, and stared at the moon: the moon was rising higher and higher, it rose in the sky; it illuminated the roots of trees and rocks in the forest, dark ravines, as well as dark corners in the village, the ruins of fortresses and ancient buildings, it lit candles on the black stones of the cemetery with its rays; even the cemetery looked graceful and alive. All hope of hunting and raiding was dashed. Day's scales are night. What could they do? Their hope was shattered, they lost their courage, they started looking at each other; they thought, they chose, who among us is expendable, edible. One was ready to attack another and tear it in half.
Old Totia, with his head down, was huddled in the back of the pack, lost in thought; he had seen a lot of hunger and experienced a lot of hardship, but he wasn't particularly worried, even now he was hunting with the hope of others; the young wolves would share their food with him.
"Totia, hey, can't you hear?! What are you brooding over, can't you see what's happening? We're dying of hunger, the wolf lineage is about to disappear from the face of the earth. What does your remedy say, uncle?" said one wolf to him, hitting him on the head with a branch.
"What are you doing, you fool, you insolent Viro?" said the old wolf angrily. The other wolves perked up their ears, sensing the situation.
"Well, what?!" they all roared together: "You deserve it, you fool, one branch on someone like you is not enough. Bite him, bite him; this light is all his fault!" - they growled. They didn't let him go for long and added their teeth to their paws...
"Guys, be smart, be smart! What are you doing, you fools?" Totia mumbled and bared his teeth at one, then another, but who would be scared of his bared teeth? In an instant, Totia's life ended; along with his body, his spirit also perished. Not even a single hair of his long-suffering fur was left. If you could find a trace of blood somewhere, that was it. The wolves' hearts calmed down a little, but they were still hungry. They looked at each other, afraid of each other, probably thinking - don't eat me now. They were scared and cautious. They avoided each other, rustling could be heard in the bushes, along with the crunching of snow... The moon had risen, it had floated high, almost in the middle of the sky, shining brightly, and from there, like a guardian, it was protecting the earth from the enemy... And the wolves were running aimlessly through the forest, and the words "It's dawn, it's dawn!" were on everyone's lips.
