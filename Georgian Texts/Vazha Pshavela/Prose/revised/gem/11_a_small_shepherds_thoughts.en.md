I was raised in hardship, brother.
Ever since I could walk, I've been like someone else's child. 
At the age of seven, my father sent me to work for the Didghura family, and for these five years, my father has been paying off his debts with my wages. 
Every year he comes to collect my earnings
but he hasn't even bought me a knife to cut my nails with. 
Oh, I wish my parents were alive, what would we do then!..
Loneliness has made me strong: often four months will pass without seeing another soul. What kind of companionship can I have with an old grandfather? 
Sometimes I don't even want to go home in the evenings; he'll start grumbling right away, he's always grumbling, muttering: "You look at the sheep like a demon, you can't even find them a grassy spot."
In our mountains, you don't have to look for grass, thank goodness for the Lashara Cross!
My inseparable companion is my sheepdog, Ghurshia. 
May his owner be blessed, Ghurshia won't let anyone bully me! 
The other day, Tighuna from the Papura family went hunting partridges, while I snuck away from my father's mowing. 
I had just spread the sheep out on the hazelnut plain when I heard a voice from above – "Thilo, hey, Thilo!"
"Who are you, friend or foe?" I shouted back.
"If you're a man, come up here and wrestle me," Tighuna said boastfully. 
I wasn't afraid, so we wrestled. 
Tighuna was better at technique, I was stronger, it was an even match. 
In the end, he knocked me down and grabbed my throat.
My Ghurshia saw that Tighuna wasn't joking anymore, so he jumped in, knocked him down, and if I hadn't intervened, he would have torn him to shreds.
My Ghurshia has never been beaten by a dog; he's proud and big-hearted, and he won't put up with me either. If I annoy him without reason, he won't look at me with a kind eye for three days – he'll sulk. 
It was a close call; Tighuna almost got a new chokha (traditional Georgian coat) and red bruises. 
Who's going to hurt me? I won't even mention the red bruises, maybe just white ones?!
My father is a heartless man, I don't pity him at all, I cherish my mother's memory. 
In these five years, they've only let me visit my mother at the Didghura house once.
My mother was so happy to see me, she kissed me for a long time: "May my poor child be blessed," she would say every time she kissed me.
My mother gave me a pair of colorful socks; she had also saved this red-collared shirt for me.
She asked me everything in detail: "How do the Didghuras treat you? Do they beat you or starve you? 
How long have you had these rags on your body, my child?" 
The Didghuras do treat me badly, but how could I tell my mother that? 
When my mother saw my clothes, the torn leather and rags, she started arguing with my father: "Damn you, why did you give this child away to strangers, 
why are you making him wander the earth?!" As she said this, tears like hazelnut kernels streamed from her eyes and filled her lap.
I felt sorry for her, I felt sorry for myself, and I started to cry.
My mother washed my clothes, sewed up the rags, oiled the leather, and dressed me. 
I hadn't eaten white bread in a long time, but my mother baked me a loaf, borrowed white flour from the neighbors, "hid it" in the erbo (a traditional Georgian bread oven), and fed me. 
My heart longed for home, I didn't want to go back to the sheep. 
I wonder why I followed my father like someone else's child? 
The Didghuras never send me to weddings or church festivals... 
"Your wedding is with the sheep," they say. 
I remember the red-dressed women dancing, the celebrations of my peers, the singing, and my heart aches...
The wolf isa terrible threat. 
I wish I had a rifle to scare it away. 
I begged my mother, "Buy me some bullets and ask my father for his rifle." 
She promised, but I don't know if she'll keep her word.
If I get a rifle, I'll take revenge on the goats and partridges that don't respect me now, appearing on cliff tops with their horns when I least expect it, or sending avalanches of sand when they're in a herd, and the partridges will take off with a flutter right in front of me – let's see if they'll still disrespect me then!
While I was home, Vaso, the son of our priest, came to visit. 
He told me that there are many bullets in the city. I wish he would give me some...
Oh, I wish I was educated too! 
Vaso told me so many things he had seen and heard.
Even though my grandfather told me about the sky, that it was made of ice, Vaso laughed when I told him that, saying why hasn't it melted yet.
Vaso was dressed beautifully: he wore a chokha, a colorful akhalukhi (traditional Georgian shirt), and a silver belt with a dagger. 
His father even bought him a rifle. 
Who's going to buy me anything?! 
When I grow up, I'll buy everything myself: I'll have plenty of bullets, a silver-inlaid rifle, a chokha with gold embroidery...
Vaso gave me one bullet, but I burned it right there on the spot.
Vaso is kind-hearted. 
If I had that partridge that my Ghurshia caught for me yesterday, I would have given it to him. 
What do I need it for? 
It will just die for nothing
even though it's in a basket, my grandfather doesn't pay any attention to it, doesn't feed it anything...
Poor thing! 
How it fluttered, how its heart beat when I first picked it up
a falcon was chasing it.
When I heard a thunder-like sound, a whoosh
I turned my head and saw: a partridge in front and a falcon behind, hidden
both coming towards me. 
The sheep were in Kobtkhevi at the time, I was sitting by the water, making a shepherd's flute. 
The frightened partridge lost its way and fell into a puddle in front of me
my Ghurshia jumped and caught it. 
The falcon broke off, flew up high with a cry, and disappeared into the sky. 
I picked up the partridge.
Poor thing! 
It was trembling and trying to fly away, its frightened eyes darting back and forth
last night it seemed more relaxed, twice it looked through the window, eyes closed, sitting sullenly.
Last year, my Ghurshia did something even more amazing. 
Once I had the sheep in Aphkhuso's tails (a place name). 
The grass was wet from the rain the night before. 
I, already wet, got even wetter. 
The sun was just starting to redden the mountain peaks. 
I sat on a rock and waited for the sunrise. 
There was a juniper tree in front of me... 
An eagle appeared in the Saparavi Gorge
it soared proudly, only occasionally bowing its head and turning its neck from side to side. 
Two crows were bothering it, not giving it any peace.
One of them would flash, turn upside down, and cry "craa, craa." 
The eagle didn't pay any attention to the crows, it didn't flinch from their attacks
it only occasionally shrugged its shoulders and moved to the side. 
One crow was particularly persistent. 
The eagle got angry, flapped its wings; the crow came up head down, with a trail of feathers following it, a gust of wind carried some of its feathers up into the sky. 
The eagle didn't care, it continued on its way calmly, scanning the abyss. 
The second crow then backed off. 
The eagle passed by Sadzeri (a place name), and I lost sight of it.
Then a hawk appeared from Akhuni (a place name). 
It held a bone in its claws; the hawk was playing with the bone: it would drop it on the ground and swoop down on it, then pick it up again. 
It went up high, released the bone from its claws, and followed it down itself; it did this several times, dropping and catching the bone.
Soon it came close to me, but it couldn't see me, the juniper tree was hiding me, and Ghurshia was lying beside me. 
Aphkhuso's tails are rocky, and the hawk kept dropping the bone closer to the rocks. 
God must have been angry with it because the hawk dropped the bone close to us
Ghurshia jumped on it, and before the hawk could pick it up, Ghurshia had already grabbed it. 
The hawk was upset, it hissed like a snake and quickly disappeared into the rocks like a gunshot.
Later, I asked my grandfather: "Why was the hawk doing that, my grandpa?" 
"That's how hawks do it," he told me, "when they can't break a bone with their beak to get to the marrow, they drop it from a height onto the rocks to shatter it, and then they can get to the marrow." 
Glory to you, God, even birds have so much intelligence!.. 
Oh, mountains, how many wonderful things there are to see here!.. 
In the spring, when the snow melts, bilberries and blueberries appear in the meadows. I'll pick some young blueberries, take them home, and mix them with milk. 
Is there anything more delicious?!
This is also the time for lambing, when the lambs are born. 
I can't sleep day or night for joy.
The lambs and their mothers are bleating... 
But, oh! In two years, the Didghuras will send me home, and how can I go to my mother empty-handed, without even a sheepskin to bring her?
