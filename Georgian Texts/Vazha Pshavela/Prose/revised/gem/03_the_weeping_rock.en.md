The rock stands unyielding, firm, jaw-clenched, and angry. 
It stands the same, unchanging, winter and summer. 
This rock is a whole mountain turned into a rock, facing the sky, the sun and the earth below. 
At first glance, how disgustingly, disproportionately it is plowed, with stones piled on top of each other irregularly, disorderly: in some places blackened, in some places yellowed, in other places bluish, scratched, wrinkled, washed and grooved by the flood. 
You look, you look carefully and how beautiful it seems to you, like a warrior who has gone through a thousand wars, wounded and injured by a thousand, but still bravely, courageously and stubbornly looking out and fighting. 
If he is a strong enemy, he is always alert, always with his neck stretched out and looks intently in one direction: from there, he probably expects the enemy.
Two kinds of anger kill the rock's heart: one is the sky, the other is the valley. 
He looks at the valley, the open fields, beautifully displayed. 
The valley appears to the mountain to be lying down to sleep. 
This kills the rock's heart: why doesn't it always stand on its feet like me, why isn't it awake.
He curses the valley's useless wealth. 
He loves the valley, he always looks at it with his eyes and eyebrows, he cannot be satisfied with its love, he wants to go and hug it, 
But the rock cannot break its own rule, he cannot go. 
The poor man has never had the honor to taste the sweetness of love. 
This made him even more stunned, even more heartbroken, but love has strengthened a thousand times in the rock's heart. 
How the poor man wants to pluck a rose or a violet on his beloved's chest. 
Consumed by hopeless love, he kills himself by asking the eagles, his raised children, about the news of the valley, when they will return from their travels and sit on his lap...
Poor rock, poor thing! 
I understand, I understand your life, your heart's response. 
You are still a rock, you will not break your rockiness, you will not be shaken, because you are a rock...
Yes, the eagles will circle their parent's head and tell them: on this and this day blood was shed in the valley, on this and this day love fell...
The rock cries at night so that no one can see and condemn it. 
His crying is more than the crying of the sky.
He still does not shed as many tears as he can, he is afraid that the valley will not be flooded. 
Nobody knows this and that's why they say: "It's a rock, it's hard, what does it know about crying, what kind of anger will it get?" 
The mountains listen intently to the rock's cry and put on a black fog as a helmet for black thoughts. 
The tearful lamb, hanging on the rock's chin, listens to the mother's cry with a broken heart and tells the news, but its voice is swallowed by the rock's cry. 
Eagles, with anger in their hearts, will get angry at the rock's cry and cover their heads under their shoulders. 
The moon will be the first to meet the rock and it will also murmur when it looks down on its head: "Why are you crying, why, my poor friend?!"
The rock's tears will fall on its face, wash its heart and go down crying. 
He goes and cries: I am a rock tear, nature, I am the fruit of his sorrow; A pile of flowers on your chest It is taken with my dew.
The valley will also ask the rock for news and tears will tell: He is still standing, sister, as usual, As befits a rock, rocky, Although in the end your wish Crying gave him a law.
Otherwise, it's good, it's whole With head, heart, root.
Where will the fortress come, built With milk-mixed lime, To the rock, so firm it is With a beautifully displayed face.
The valley will lay the rock's tears on its heart, comfort it, and become one with it. 
When the eagles tell him this, the rock will rest a little. 
It is not only the rock that groans and cries: someone else groans in the rock's heart, imprisoned in the darkness. 
Too much sorrow has dried up the tears in his eyes, or he has cried too much and the tears have dried up. 
What is the problem with the rock 
he still sees the sky and the sun, the earth, but this spiritual being groans in the rock's heart, he is deprived of everything except suffering. 
He is tied with a thick chain, tearful, bearded, and even moss is clinging to his body... 
No one hears his groan except the rock. 
The sword is stuck right in front of him, and his plow is lying there. 
Seeing them, his heart dies even more. 
He used to use it at one time, and now his weapon has become rusty along with him. 
Day changes by day, night by night, the sun rises and sets, but this man is not relieved.
Century is bound to century and there is no help for him, no salvation...
Who is the savior of the hero? 
No one. 
Only one marten is his master
tirelessly gnawing the chain throughout the year, and when it brings it to breaking, the blacksmith will hit the wedge on the anvil and the chain will be whole again. 
Disappointed Amirani will groan, the rock will shake and say to him: "Don't break, don't lose hope. 
I see how many storms pass over my head and I still stand strong."
At night, the devils gather at the foot of this rock and sing: Angels are offended, we love, When we see the suffering of others.
Suffer, you are suffering,
Why did you disturb the demons' dwelling?!
You raised a sea of ​​demon blood, You would put the dead in a row.
The sword would always cut you The body of demons and iron on the body.
Now go to Darejan And his sister Tina.
Don't bore them with groans, Amirani, Pray to Fina: Gnaw the plow and the chain, Give your hand a sword...
Seeker of good for the country, Your glory is gone.
Groan a thousand times more, You have shed a little, Drink so bitterly The days of your life.
When the devils finish this song, a bird the size of a wall lizard will come out of the rock, it will also bring out the light and call to the devils: May God be angry with you With thepower of the three trinity, That Amirani's suffering You will not warm up with guilt.
You will still see Amirani With a sword in hand, a plow on his body, He would chase you, crush you With his strong arm.
