I have committed no sin in my life. 
Not a single living being, not even an inanimate object, can speak of my sin, my wickedness. 
This is how God has ordained me: I must flow, flow; everyone must quench their thirst with me. 
On a hot summer day, how many animals come and drink my water. 
How many tired and weary workers come, bringing scythes and sickles to sharpen. 
People drink from me, and one in a thousand might say: "Bless you, cold mountain spring
what wine can compare to you?!" 
Most spit on me.
What can I do
I can't spit on anyone. 
Let them spit on me again!
How happy I feel, oh God! 
What good friends I have around me! 
Here are these rocks, thickly covered with green moss; here is the yellow cliff above me, watching over me, protecting my head like a helmet. 
How these giant-like boulders reach for the sky and don't even let the sun's rays reach me! 
Thick, snake-like intertwined roots have settled in my lap and bosom. 
I am happy and innocent for only two or three miles
then a huge river will swallow me, my name, my identity will be lost. 
It will play with me however it wants. It roars, rages, crashes here and there, destroys the earth, tears up trees and carries them away, it will do the same to me. 
But then I am no longer what I am now, at this moment, when I am first born from the cliff. 
Oh, my heart is breaking because of this river!
How many times have I heard people screaming here: "The water has swept away a man, help
doesn't anyone believe in God?!" It's not a small thing, I am also blamed. 
Oh, woe is me!
I wish the Creator had not ordained me this way, and I could flow endlessly, water the plants, the beautiful heart of the earth, quench the thirst of humans and animals! 
How happy I feel when I pass by a wilting fern, and it embraces me, greets me, and sews me a dress from its leaves. 
Then I gurgle in the bushes, and they surround me and lovingly call out: "Hail to the mountain spring, hail!"
Now I will moisten the roots of the hazelnuts and ferns crushed by the avalanche and make them look up...
Oh, God, why do you let that lazy, annoying, useless, restless river destroy my creation! 
What a bad dream I had last night!.. 
Creator God, 
our master, 
our protector, 
make it come true!.. 
I saw that I was dying. 
A drought, a great drought had set in
the grass, the moss, my parents, had withered, and I had almost dried up too. 
A dove, a beautiful "beech bird," flew down from an alder branch and wanted to bathe in my pool, but it couldn't wet its wings and started crying. 
I saw this and my heart was dying: "Where are you going, my grace," I murmured. 
The withered dogwood, hawthorn, maple, birch, and fern - they were all worried together: "Let's bring water to the spring
don't let it dry up!" 
They offered me a few drops of dew from their leaves, branches, and roots, but they couldn't help me anymore. 
And it was as if the earth had opened its mouth and I was about to perish in an endless abyss.
I got scared and woke up. 
My heart was pounding, sweat was pouring down my forehead. 
I looked up, the ravine was filled with fog. 
The rock shook its branches, rocked my cradle, and murmured: "Don't be afraid, little one, you won't dry up, you won't disappear!" 
At that moment, the deer, usually cautious and prudent during the day, with its antlers thrown back, "the beautiful-necked one," came running, reached for my holy water, drank, and was satisfied. 
Then, with a relieved heart, I said: "I am not dry, I am not!"
