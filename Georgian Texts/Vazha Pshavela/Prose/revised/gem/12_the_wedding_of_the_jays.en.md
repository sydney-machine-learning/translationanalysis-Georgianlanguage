This story happened in a large, dark, and dense forest, far away from villages and towns.
What story, you ask? 
Let me tell you about the wedding of the finches. 
The finch Zakara was marrying the beautiful, renowned for her charm, and exceedingly clever finch Ketevan. 
The elderly finch Toma was officiating the wedding of these two young birds.
Toma diligently lifted his eyes to the heavens and proclaimed: "Bless, O Lord, their crowns, instill in them love and loyalty for each other, let them multiply like fish in the water, stars in the sky, make the bed of your servant Zakara and your handmaiden Ketevan undefiled.
Amen." Saying this, he placed crowns of beautiful flowers on both their heads.
"Amen!" "Amen!" echoed from here and there, like a chorus. These were the invited guests, the birds: finches, warblers, wrens, nightingales, cuckoos, owls, woodpeckers, robins, swallows, sparrows, larks, thrushes, and many others. 
There was no more space, so many guests had gathered. 
The flowers were happy too, they were also invited to the wedding. 
A cold, clear spring flowed nearby. 
The table was laid out long, laden with all sorts of food and fruit. 
You name any kind of worm or fly, they had brought it here, along with all sorts of grass seeds...
The bride and groom were invited to a flower-strewn throne, and the guests sat down in rows. 
A great feast began, with eating and drinking. All sorts of drinks were served: Kakhetian ruby wine flowed like water on the table... 
Everyone toasted the bride and groom, and everyone presented gifts.
A woodpecker was sitting on a branch nearby, in a hollow. He shouted "Many years!"
"Hey you, squawker, you're not drinking wine, you rascal, what's going on? Drink wine, come on!" the birds shouted at the woodpecker in unison.
"Wait, guys, give me a moment, I swear to God I'll toast you: I found a nice fat worm here, I want to dig it out, and then, I'll drink as much wine as you want, no worries, I'll be at peace" the woodpecker replied
and started pecking at the tree with his beak. 
Everyone turned their attention to the woodpecker.
"Well, you know best, you brave one," - the birds called to the woodpecker.
"If you don't get it out, woe to you, we won't let you eat bread, you know."
For a long time, the woodpecker's beak and feet made a racket on the hollow tree, and not in vain: the woodpecker pulled out a long worm, like a snake's young, and presented it to the bride and groom with his beak.
"Cheers to the bride and groom!" - the woodpecker shouted loudly.
"Cheers to the company, hurrah!"
"Cheers, cheers! Hurrah! Well done, woodpecker!
Thank goodness you didn't disgrace yourself or us" the birds shouted. 
The toastmaster, since the woodpecker had shown bravery, offered him a jug full of wine; he downed it in one gulp and threw the empty jug back to the toastmaster. The same priest, finch Toma, was chosen as the toastmaster.
"They eat bread and drink wine, but they don't sing," said the crow and started a table song with his beautiful voice. 
The crow was given applause from all sides, and he sang louder, so that the forest echoed. The mountains and valleys trembled. 
The flowers were dying of laughter.
Nearby, a mouse had a burrow. 
The noise disturbed him, and he peeked out of his hole.
He watched the birds' feast for a long time, their merriment, he saw the rich, nutritious food, colorful, diverse, and greedily swallowed saliva after saliva. 
He endured for a long time, but couldn't bear it anymore
whatever happens, happens, he said; he crept closer, jumped, and landed right on the nut-filled table in front of the bride and groom.
"Whoever comes, cheers! Cheers to the mouse!" - came the collective voice of the birds.
"Oh my, you scared us, buddy!" - the startled birds said to the mouse.
"May you be blessed, may you be blessed, may you be happy and healthy, may the Lord, the Creator, never deprive you of joy and good deeds," said the mouse
and at the same time he was nibbling on a hearty nut, slowly cracking it with his teeth.
"Offer wine to the mouse, wine," the toastmaster shouted
"He has a long way to go before he's like us."
"I won't touch wine, thank you very much, nuts are better than the light of my eyes, you guys enjoy yourselves; I'll nibble on nuts, I'm doing fine."
"You won't touch it, what kind of answer is that! Come on, drink, or we'll pour wine on your head," the toastmaster said threateningly to the mouse and handed the jug to the woodpecker.
The woodpecker took the jug from Toma and sat down next to the mouse.
"Drink, hey, brother, it's a wedding, isn't it! Nibble on nuts, what kind of order is that! Hey, if you're nibbling, pass me the jug" 
said the woodpecker and offered the jug.
"I can't drink, for God's sake, leave me alone, I can't and what can I do, why am I in this mess"
the mouse replied and turned away.
"Pour it on him, pour it on his head, that donkey!" the toastmaster shouted
"So, you don't want to toast the bride and groom, you fool!?"
"Wine doesn't agree with me, guys, now you want to make me drink wine?! How can that be, what kind of whim is this!? You are all honorable, decent people. 
Here, I'll take a sip for the bride and groom's toast."
"Make him drink,make him drink, that rascal
he has to drink by force
it's not allowed. 
Why did he come here if he doesn't drink wine
make him drink, make him drink" the birds' voices were heard.
The woodpecker grabbed the mouse by the neck with one hand, put the wine-filled jug to his mouth with the other hand, and started forcing him to drink.
"If it were up to you, I know you wouldn't drink, sir, but here the toastmaster's will is law.
Look at this whole world, it's not like no one here drinks wine, you're the only one who's being difficult.
Come on, drink it, drink it, it's not a sin to turn away from wine like it's mother's milk, you ungrateful creature!"
The mouse, with great difficulty, swallowed a few drops and squeaked, apparently not enjoying the wine.
"Drink it, mouse, drink it! Come on, come on! Bottoms up, bottoms up! 
Ah, good boy!" the birds shouted at the mouse.
The mouse gasped, tightened his throat muscles, fought the wine, and gulped it down, finishing it. 
A little wine spilled on his velvet coat.
"Don't spill wine on your coat, hey, you clumsy one, is it like your mother's porridge that you're treating it so carelessly?!" he attacked the woodpecker.
Then he took a deep breath. 
He was just about to take the last gulp and shouted: Cheers to the bride and groom! 
Cheers to your bride, buddy!..
"Cheers, cheers! He finished it, he finished it!" the excited voices were heard.
The mouse quickly felt the effects of the wine and started singing ballads. 
He sang so loudly that everyone's ears were ringing. 
Then he started dancing. 
He made everyone laugh. 
The magpie joined him, and they both danced the lezginka.
The crows were holding their stomachs, they were laughing so hard at this sight.
"Ugh, I'm tired," said the mouse finally; indeed, sweat was dripping from his face and chest.
He lay down right there near the table. He turned his bulging belly towards the sky and snored.
Finally, the nightingale was sitting at the table.
the singing bird was not celebrating,not laughing, he was watching the spectacle, sad and thoughtful.
"Beautiful nightingale, why don't you let us hear your beautiful voice?" the birds asked the nightingale.
The nightingale refused; he said, "I'm not always in the mood for singing, I'm feeling down."
As it happened, the birds' pleading and begging worked, and the nightingale started singing. 
The birds' voices fell silent, the buzzing of flies could be heard, the flowers breathed a sigh of relief and watched the singer with loving eyes. 
The nightingale sang:
Glory to you, ruler of the heavens, Glory to you, force of nature, Glory, crowned king, And a toast to you, bride!
I will weave a crown of love, Embroider it with kindness,
I will not spare, I will weave in everything, If I find anything good in the world.
And with a sincere heart,I will place it on your heads, man and woman.
Love itself is my heart, If I see it in others, it sets me ablaze.
Today your love is the greatest, And with this, it captures our hearts and eyes.
At that moment, a deer appeared nearby, listening intently to the birds singing and the cuckoo's call. The cuckoo's song stirred sadness in its heart, 
bringing back memories. Tears welled up in its eyes, it sighed, and turned away, seeking refuge in the dense forest.
The birds erupted in a chorus of song. 
They all sang the same melody, but each with their unique voice. 
This song depicted the praise of nature, the grace of the forest and the Earth. 
The birds offered their gratitude for this grace. Suddenly, an eagle soared overhead. 
"Eagle!" "Eagle!" voices cried out, "The king is coming!"
All the birds fell silent, too afraid to utter a sound. They trembled with fear.
Indeed, the sight of the eagle was terrifying at that moment. What did it want? 
It only took one swoop for the eagle to turn the flock of birds into a chaotic mess.
"Why are you scared, people?" the magpie, their teacher, asked. "Would the king dare to harm us, desire it?! 
If you tell me, I will summon the king right now."
Some disagreed, saying, "Who can withstand the glare of his eyes?" They lamented that they could no longer enjoy themselves and wondered what would become of them. 
Others agreed, "Let's invite him, let's invite him."
The magpie flew up and playfully addressed the king of the birds. 
The eagle didn't change its course, as if a fly was buzzing in front of it.
"Greetings to Your Majesty, our King," the magpie said, bowing respectfully.
"Greetings to the magpie as well," the eagle replied calmly.
"Our noble King, we request your presence at our wedding. 
We ask you with our hearts and souls; we implore you on our knees, your entire subjects. 
If Your Majesty would grace us with your presence, we would be deeply indebted to you."
"Perhaps, why not!" said the eagle. "Lead the way!"
The magpie descended, and the eagle folded its powerful wings and followed suit. 
This sight resembled the tearing of the sky.
The entire flock of birds rose and greeted their king with cheers and excitement.
The eagle offered its own unique greeting to the gathering of birds.
They invited the king and seated him at the head of the table. 
All the birds stood respectfully, hats removed. 
Only the cuckoo was absent.
"You may be seated," the eagle told them, and the birds arranged themselves according to their seniority.
This event occurred on a Monday.
People who went to the forest, whether for work or hunting, were amazed. 
Everyone said, "What's happening? What has silenced the birds that not a single sound can be heard?"
Little did the people know that the birds were at the magpie's wedding, indulging in merriment and feasting.
They served wine to the eagle in goblets. He drank effortlessly and became quite cheerful.
He roared a heroic song in his terrifying voice, sending shivers down everyone's spines.
"Oh God," they all prayed, "Oh God, please don't anger our king, or he will destroy us in an instant."
The eagle, however, wasn't angry. He asked the birds to rejoice, sing, and dance
but something changed their mood. 
They didn't know what had come over them. 
To give the birds courage, the eagle ordered them to play the bagpipes and drums.
The command was carried out immediately, and the eagle started to dance with its powerful claws, almost trampling the entire flower-filled area.
Still, no one dared to play. Finally, the partridge gathered the courage. It danced so energetically, jumping so high that the dust reached the sky.
Once, in the excitement, it even jumped over the eagle. 
The king was slightly offended by this foolish act of his subject, but due to politeness and the occasion, he said nothing
only scowling once, which nearly scared the partridge to death. 
However, after that scowl, the partridge was no longer fit, fell ill, and lay down at the base of a tree, covering itself with a dry poplar leaf.
Among the birds, the woodpecker behaved the most boldly.
It had also had a few drinks and was singing ballads that made the entire mountain and valley shake.
The woodpecker became so bold that it even confronted the king.
"Who gave you the right to rule?" it asked the eagle. "When did we elect you?"
"Boy, you family wrecker, be quiet, what are you saying, you insolent fool?" the other birds whispered to him.
"I won't be quiet, and that's that! Why should I be quiet, what's it to me?!.." the drunken woodpecker continued. 
"What kind of people are you? In your hearts, you all resent him, you cowards, but you can't say it to his face. Manhood is speaking your mind."
The eagle laughed at the woodpecker's antics, but the birds considered it an insult to their king. They seized the woodpecker, pierced its beak, and tied it to a tree. 
The woodpecker became dejected, no longer making a sound. It didn't understand why it had been punished so cruelly.
While the birds were engrossed in this revelry, a fox was sneaking up on them. 
The cunning animal had been watching from the edge of the forest for a long time, waiting for the right moment, thinking, "Once they're drunk, it's my time."
They noticed the fox just as it was about to snatch the bride and groom. 
A commotion arose, the flock of birds scattered, and the eagle, despite his injured beak, pounced on the fox and killed it in an instant. 
The birds dispersed: some perched on trees, others soared high above. 
Only the eagle and the woodpecker remained below. The sick partridge also found a hole in the commotion. 
The eagle freed the woodpecker and said, "I forgive your rudeness because you were drunk, but don't you dare do it again, or your skin won't be safe."
The eagle itself took flight, soaring high as if touching the sky, and began to circle above. 
Ketevan and Zakara also sought refuge in the dense forest, spending the day and evening in each other's embrace. They fell asleep side by side on a branch of a hornbeam tree.
