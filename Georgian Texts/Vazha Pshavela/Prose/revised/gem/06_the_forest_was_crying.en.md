On a meadow surrounded by dense, shadowy forest, a great commotion could be heard. Men, women, children, and dogs were buzzing around like flies! Most of the people were armed with guns. Everyone's face glowed with pleasure and happiness, everyone's lips were adorned with smiles; the people were gathered around a slain deer, killed by the hunters this morning. The child of the forest, raised in the heart of the forest and grown strong, lay lifeless; its eyes, slaughtered eyes, floated in murky water; its tongue hung out.
When the hunter's horses saw the dead deer, they snorted and turned away, not wanting to look at the dead deer, so they grazed on the green grass at the end of the field, their reins trailing. The children, who had not yet admired the deer, were now clinging to the branches of its antlers.
"Quickly skin it, quickly!" the women urged, "Let's see how the venison tastes grilled!"
Someone shouted:
"Come on, women, before the grilled meat is ready, let's breathe in the air, get our blood moving, we'll enjoy it even more. So, until the grilled meat is ready, let's have some dancing, drums, and pipes!"
"It will be very good, very good," a man with a big mustache chimed in and was the first to start dancing, prancing like a young bull; he was the first to welcome the sound of the drums and pipes with open arms. Others followed him, swirling on the grass, enjoying life. Some didn't have time: they were skinning the deer. The killing of the deer had multiplied the joy; everyone's wish had been fulfilled; they had killed the deer, that's why this crowd of people had come out to the field, to kill a deer or a roe deer, and they had done it. Their hearts' desires had been fulfilled; everyone there was happy today. Only the forest, the surrounding nature, was not happy; the forest was crying, crying bitterly, the mountain slopes overlooking the meadow where the deer was being skinned. The slopes covered in dark forest were sending sighs and moans, carried by the wind, to the meadow where the deer lay.
The old trees - lindens, oaks, elms, hornbeams, alders, pines, birches, maples, and others - were whispering, all of them together, although they stood far apart from each other, had heard the death of their beloved child. The forest is the mother of the deer, the forest nursed it, the forest rocked its cradle, the forest covered it as a blanket. The forest raised and nurtured the deer, and the forest was proud of itself for raising such a young, beautiful child.
The beauty of the deer was interwoven with the beauty of the forest itself. The charm of the deer is proof of the forest's beauty. Can the ugly, the unpleasant, give birth to beauty? In the deer, the forest saw itself. The deer is the pride of the forest. Tell me, has the forest ever spared anything that the deer's eyes and mouth could reach?! The deer ruled the inaccessible forest as its complete property; the forest was happy about this, it wasn't offended: it wanted its child, its raised one, to be beautiful, young, intelligent and strong, a famous young man.
The goodness of the deer was the goodness of the forest itself, just as the goodness of a child is always the glory of the parent.
"Oh my beauty, oh my head! Light would fill my heart when it passed before me and gazed at me with its beautiful, innocent eyes," said a rock in the forest, covered in green and yellow moss, intertwined with the roots of oaks and pines.
The deer, the companions of the slain one, who would give them time to mourn, ran away in fear, their own lives were their concern. Even the rustle of a woodcock in the forest seems like death to them. They dart their eyes back and forth, prick up their ears - sharpening their hearing. They sniff the wind; the smell of humans frightens them more than wolves...
The forest was crying...
Under the shade of a large oak, a long table was set, its edges adorned with a row of people - men and women. There was eating and drinking, a great feast, the clinking of glasses, and the sound of "many years" and "cheers" could be heard. Singing was followed by dancing, laughter, and merriment.
The sun dipped towards the west; evening was approaching; the hunters prepared to go home; the women packed the cart; the young men mounted their horses. They held their guns proudly, as much as possible; each of their glances silently proclaimed to the others: "We are hunters, very skilled at shooting, and therefore good fellows!"...
The hunters went home, thinking about when they would visit the forest again and kill two or three deer instead of one.
The hunters returned home satisfied and happy. The field was left orphaned, with only a campfire visible, where an hour ago the fire had crackled and venison skewered on wooden skewers had been roasting; where a long table had been set and the laughter and merriment of men and women could be heard. Here and there lay the gnawed bones of the deer, the remnants of the dogs' feast after the humans.
And the forest cried and said: "Oh my glorious son, my dear, when will I raise another child like you, adorned with antlers and a strong body; I was proud of you, and from this day on, who will I be proud of?!"
The forest moaned and shed tears.
