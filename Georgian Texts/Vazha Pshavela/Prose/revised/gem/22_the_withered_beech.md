Everyone, including me, loves a tall mountain adorned with greenery and flowers; the smell of spring, the newly sprouted grass, which is better than the newly melted ice, has appeared innocently, harmlessly and looks at the sun, the earth, it is in a hurry, it is waving, but an inexpressible love is spread over its delicate, confused face.
I came to life, thank you to my creator, it seems to be murmuring. 
It is lovely when the frozen trees are covered with leaves and others bloom with the warmth of spring. 
What can compare to a dim, dense, dark, misty forest!..
But at this moment I forget everything and only one dry beech tree appears in front of my eyes. 
It also stands in a dense forest, on top of a rock. 
This rock is also covered with green moss like velvet. 
Other trees stand far away from the dry beech, as if they are deliberately separated and proudly stop on their heads. 
Near the dry beech, several raspberry legs have come, with leaves eaten by deer and deer. 
They are strained and look down at the river, several sweet roots come at its roots, green in winter and summer, with serrated leaves, the dry beech has lost its sign of life.
Only three branches remain below the middle waist, the upper body is broken and stuck in the ravine, withered. 
In these three branches, only three or four leaves will come out once a year, and they are also discolored, withered, yellowed. 
And if you look at other trees, they stand loaded with the sustenance given by nature. 
They don't care about the dry beech, they don't pay attention, only in winter, when they themselves are robbed of their wedding dress, and, to a greater or lesser extent, they get closer to the dry beech, then they will look at it, even furtively... 
This will happen right when the bare-faced, hair-disheveled "mother of the place" tells a fairy tale about love, purity and life to comfort nature. 
Then they will grumble at the dry beech: "What are you staring at, poor thing? Listen to what he says!"
The dry beech groans with a deep groan and does not listen to these proud plants, neither well nor badly, but it listens to the fairy tale of the "mother of the place"; Each of his words falls on his heart like a plow and silently sheds tears.
Poor beech! 
There was a time when this one also stood proudly stretched out, rising far above other trees and covering the entire forest like a hut with its large branches and leaves. 
The eagle coming from the mountain to the valley rested on its top, proudly following the barking. 
Now, however, he is completely discouraged, ready to fall. 
In several places on his body, the poor man has removed the dried bark and his swollen sides are visible. 
In one place, the bark is longer and protrudes towards the earth; You would think they stabbed him with a dagger and pulled out his intestines. 
This beech also has a lot of worms, because whenever I have to pass near it, I always see a woodpecker on it. 
This doomed one sits on it all the time and, with all his strength and energy, hammers that withered, desolate beak; He also pecks and pecks, as if he understands the sign. 
See how many places he has hollowed out the beech to the heart. 
He will soon start grinding his heart. 
The beech stands, stands undisturbed, without frowning; He says neither good nor bad.
When the wind blows, other trees sway, only the dry beech does not move; Before, when he was healthy, full of life, he would start to swell like the sea at the blowing of the wind; Its branches and leaves would make a noise like thunder. 
The branches of the dry beech proudly beat the earth, burst, alas, now the dry beech cannot follow the wind like other trees, as before, stubbornly cannot oppose the storm. 
The dry beech will not be uprooted, and if it falls, what can we say about it... 
It will fall, fall, lie on its side, the roots will appear, raised up, as if they were praying, begging God, asking for help. 
In summer, dry beech is more pitiful. 
Other trees are decorated with green leaves, harmless, carefree.
A thousand birds sit on them to sing, deer hum on their branches, a pheasant sings an endless song, a finch cuts their fields with chirping and jumps restlessly; The stretched-necked deer and deer shade them. 
These leafy trees proudly look down on the poor dry beech, they are disgusted by it and say: "I wish you wouldn't make us ugly!"
They do not know that the dry beech remembers them more and there are, they will find such people who like and love the dry beech that has fallen into misfortune... 
In the village, they remember the dry beech at least three times a day, - Where did you take the cattle today? – When the father asks his children, they show the area of ​​the dry beech, across or across, the head or the end.
A wolf has nested at the root of a dry beech, in a rock, there is a voice in the village: He has laid cubs. 
The hunters saw the tracks of the mother wolf and her cubs around the dry beech.
This cursed mushroom will crush the dry beech, says the other.
Yes, the foolish trees do not know that people have not yet forgotten the name of the dry beech, they still remember its greatness.
Is everything that is dry is it contemptible from a man?!
A thousand living many times ten times better is one dead.
By seeing you, body, sorrow fills my heart, because I see you, how poor you are and you are ownerless.
As if the alarm went off, a mourning bell.
I want to see you for a long time and it boils in my heart share your sorrow with you, let the tears flow.
Why did you come, poor thing, don't you mourn the dead?!
There is no destruction for you, there is no salvation anywhere!
Who will make your coffin,
Who will light a candle for you?
Oh, 
How hard it is to die, the name is lost!
With a whisper, once in a thousand, an owl will sit on a dry beech and, with a hoarse voice, will follow the discouraged cry: "Did you find it?" and, when he hears the exhausted cry: "No, no," he will hang his head in pity and "hoo, hoo," he will whisper in his heart.
In winter, a wolf visits the dry beech. 
Sits next to it and groans, tormented by hunger. 
The dry beech stands undisturbed, says neither good nor bad, stands stunned.
He knows neither pity nor hunger.
His heart will not boil with enmity, nor with kindness. 
The dry beech thinks about itself, about the past, the present and the future.
It is as if sorrow is deeply embedded in his heart. 
Sometimes he looks down at the small, withered sprout that has sprouted at the end of one of his roots, waiting for the sun and rain to grow. 
This is his only comfort...
