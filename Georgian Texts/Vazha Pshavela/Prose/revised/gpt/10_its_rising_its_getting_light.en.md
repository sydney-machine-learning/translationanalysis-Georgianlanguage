Who was saying this?
Where or when? 
It is night. 
The mountains and valleys are covered with snow; everything is so tightly bound that the bones of the earth creak and crack.
Nature lies as if in a coffin, wrapped in a shroud.
There is no sound, no movement, not even the babble of a playful mountain stream is heard anywhere. 
Even the wind has deliberately stopped to not disturb the surrounding peace, not to disrupt nature's sleep and rest. 
The forest is covered with snow, and the trees' trunks and branches are no longer visible... 
At this time, a pack of wolves was gathering on a hill. 
Some had arrived early and were waiting for others. 
With howls and deep, slow voices, they were calling their comrades: "Come, don't be late!"
From below, far from the village, an indistinct noise could be heard. Smoke rising from the houses had settled over the village like a blanket, covering it, while the sky above was ablaze, studded with stars, staring down at the earth with a stern, unblinking gaze.
The wolves intended to visit the village tonight â€“ this was their thought and intention. 
They were gathering together because they found nothing to eat in the forest anymore.
For a week, they had been wandering hungry, unable to dig through the snow and ice to find food.
They gathered, forming a large pack. 
All were chattering their teeth. They were hungry, very hungry! 
They eyed each other, hoping to see a drop of blood on one another so that they would have a reason to pounce and tear their comrade to pieces. 
One wolf would not be enough for all of them
each would not even get a bite! 
No, at least they would curb their hunger a little.
The wolf meeting at this time was a remarkable sight: some lay on the snow, others were crouched, and some stood with their tails down, all with their mouths open. 
They were discussing a raid, a campaign.
"The good times are gone, good times, boys! 
How dark it is! 
Now is the time for those who believe in themselves to try," said an old wolf named Totia.
"Indeed, indeed," said another. "If we can't catch anything else outside, at least we can snatch the dogs.
You know my story? 
I will lure them out, play dead, and trick them, and then you can pounce on them and take care of the rest!"
"What do you mean we don't know how to eat carrion," others said with a laugh.
They were planning to break into the sheepfold. 
The thought of sheep made them open their mouths wider, revealing their large teeth like coals.
They gnashed their teeth, and a common, terrible fire ignited, illuminating the surroundings.
They scattered with the hope of filling their bellies
descending the hill, led by Totia. 
They licked their lips at the edge of the hill, lined up, with hope kindling in their hearts. 
But alas, fate betrayed them. 
What they didn't expect happened, what happened ruined their plans and broke their resolve. 
What happened? 
They relied on the darkness
but they noticed that the sky to the east was brightening.
They all huddled together and fixed their eyes in that direction.
A little later, the moon's peak appeared. 
The moon rose and illuminated the forest, the mountain, the dark corners; it lit up the caves.
The huddled wolves, filled with anger, cried: "It's coming up, it's coming up, it's getting brighter!" 
From the wolves' eyes fixed on the moon, arrows of hatred, anger, and bloodlust were directed at it. 
How they cursed its rise!
"May your feet dry up, may God curse you! Woe to you, woe to the day you were born!" the wolves said, gnashing their teeth. 
"Oh, if only we could catch you, eat you, and end your life."
The most furious and agitated was an old wolf.
"You have broken my heart many times," he said. 
"You have grieved me many times, you accursed, you damned one
you have grieved me, embittered my days of life. 
I have stained my nose, paws, and chest with the blood of many animals; for two whole weeks, I have adorned myself with this blood and quenched my hunger by seeing it on my body. 
If only, moon, I could once sink my sharp teeth into you, 
if only your blood could adorn my shoulders and fingers."
The others, still hungry, thought the same and stared at the moon
the moon rose higher and higher in the sky, illuminating the bases of trees and rocks in the forest, the dark ravines, and also the dark corners of the village, the ruins of ancient buildings, the black stones of the cemetery with its candle-like rays; even the cemetery looked alive and blessed. 
Every hope of raiding and plundering was dashed. 
The night is the balance of the day. 
What should they do? 
They lost hope, lost faith, and began to look at each other; they thought and decided who among them was to be eaten. 
One was ready to pounce on another and tear him in half.
Old Totia, with his face and head bloodied, crouched behind a bush, deep in thought
he had seen much hunger and suffering and was not as distressed as the others; he was still hunting on the hope of others; the young wolves shared their food with him.
"Totia, hey, can't you hear? 
Why are you so quiet? 
Can't you see what's happening? 
We're starving, the wolf clan is about to be wiped off the face of the earth. 
What does your notebook say, uncle?" one wolf said, shaking a branch over his head.
"What are you doing, you fool, you ungrateful donkey?" the old wolf said angrily. The other wolves pricked up their ears, sensing the situation.
"So what?!" they all roared together. 
"He deserves it, what he's getting, hitting him with a branch is too little. 
Bite him, bite him; this light is all his fault!" they howled. 
They did not let it go for long and added teeth to their paws... 
"Boys, be wise, be wise! What are you doing, you fools?" Totia groaned, growling his teeth at one, then another
but who would be afraid of his growling? 
In one moment, Totia's life ended; along with his flesh, his soul also perished.
Not even a hair of his much-suffered skin remained. 
If you noticed blood somewhere, that was it. 
The wolves were somewhat satisfied, but they were still hungry. 
They looked at each other, fearing each other, perhaps thinking now they will eat me. 
They got scared and ran. 
One ran from the other, the sound of their clashing and the crunching of the snow was heard... 
The moon rose, climbed higher, almost to the middle of the sky, shining brightly, guarding the earth from enemies like a sentinel... 
The wolves were running aimlessly through the forest, all with the words on their lips: "It's bright, it's bright!"
