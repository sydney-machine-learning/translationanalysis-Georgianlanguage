They stand and wait. 
The mountains' anticipation is boundless, an endless sea resides in their hearts. Red, blood-red, it glimmers in their chests. 
On the outside, on their faces, nothing is visible except enmity. 
This is also a sign of waiting. 
Who knows what is in the mountains' hearts, what fire burns and overflows there.  
Mountains, mountains! 
What do you wait for, whom do you wait for? 
Do you have a long-unseen beloved? 
Perhaps you have lost a child? 
Maybe a brother, or a mother is far away and you have received no news? 
No answer is heard. 
They stand unflinching. 
They wait, they wait and they will continue to wait. 
What can dry up the sea of waiting in their hearts? 
It has no end, no finish, like divinity...  
When all creatures, insects, grass, flowers, rivers, and restless, tireless wind fall asleep, then, and only then do the mountains sigh and shed tears. 
We, humans, say at such times: Ah, what a heavy stone-like sorrow weighs on my heart.  
Why don't you sing, mountains?! 
Must I die without hearing your voice, your song! 
Why don't you laugh? 
Show me your smile, dear ones! 
How could a single thought so dominate, capture, and subdue you that all other forces and signs of life are suppressed in your hearts and minds?! 
No, no. Sometimes you too are happy, and the world thinks you feel nothing. 
I know that candles are lit in your hearts when a joyful eagle plays above you and comes down to rest on your lap. 
How beautiful you are then! 
How well it suits you that your nurtured child is so brave, determined, and beautiful. 
After all, it is your messenger. It tells God your news...  
Don't you have thoughts? Ideas? Feelings?
Don't you dream? 
Of course, you do! 
What then are those beautiful flowers that adorn your chest? 
They are your dreams, your hopes, your consolation. 
Why do you cover yourselves with thick clouds if you aren't silently thinking about something and hiding that thought from the children of man?! 
Why do you grow grass? 
Why do you flow cold springs? 
Why do you cause avalanches? 
Why do you raise joyful goats? 
Who are you deceiving, dear ones?  
They stand and wait. 
Rain pours over them, lightning strikes their golden manes, thunder plays with their eyes, and often it pierces their chests like an arrow. 
Nothing happens. 
Often half a mountain collapses and descends into the ravine as an avalanche. 
Nothing matters, as long as the rocks and boulders wait. 
Go away, those of you who don't want to be close to the sky with us, rest below.  
Snow falls. 
It freezes. 
It's cold. 
Stones crack.
Mountains are covered in shrouds as if they were dead. 
Bury us, mourn us, â€“ they call out. 
But we expect burial from them...  
They stand and wait. 
Their hearts ache, they ache deeply. 
But they do not die, nor do they break. 
They wait, for whom? Or what? 
Something. Yes, something. 
This something is the sight of the unseen. 
They have seen and finished what their eyes and hearts could reach. 
Their eyes and hearts now yearn for something new. 
Isn't this the insatiability of the eyes and heart? 
Indeed it is.
