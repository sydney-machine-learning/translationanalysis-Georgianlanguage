I grew up in hardship, my brother. 
Since I was able to walk, I’ve always been working for others. 
When I was seven, my father sent me to serve as a shepherd boy for the Didkura family, and for the past five years, my father has been paying off his debt with my wages. 
He comes every year to collect my earnings
but he has never bought me even a simple knife. 
Oh, if only my parents were alive... 
Solitude has made me strong: often, months go by without seeing another soul; what kind of company can an old man like my grandfather provide? 
Sometimes, I’m too lazy to return to the hut in the evening; the old man will start grumbling and scolding me: “You let the devils watch over the sheep, can’t you find better grazing spots?” 
In our mountains, finding grass is not a problem, thanks to the blessings of Lashari’s cross!
My constant companion day and night is my dog, Kursha.
Bless his heart, Kursha will never let anyone hurt me! 
The other day, the old man’s son Tighuna had gone hunting for grouse, sneaking away from his father. 
I had just herded the sheep to the hazelnut grove; suddenly, I heard a voice from above – “Thilo, hey, Thilo!” 
“Who are you, friend or foe?” I shouted back from below. 
“Come up if you’re a real man and wrestle with me!” Tighuna boasted.
I wasn’t afraid, we wrestled.
He had the advantage of skill, I had the advantage of strength, it was evenly matched. 
In the end, he threw me down and grabbed me by the throat. 
Kursha saw that Tighuna wasn’t joking and attacked, knocking him down. If I hadn’t intervened, Kursha would have torn him to pieces. 
My Kursha has never been bested by another dog; he’s proud and fearless, but if I scold him for no reason, he won’t look at me for three days – he’ll sulk. 
Kursha nearly tore off Tighuna’s new coat and red trousers. 
Who would dare to cross me? I wouldn’t wear red trousers, even if I was paid to! 
My father is a hard-hearted man, he doesn’t feel sorry for me at all, unlike my dear mother. 
In these five years, I’ve hardly been allowed to go home.
When I finally went home once, my mother was so happy to see me; she kissed me many times, saying, “My poor child.” 
She gave me a pair of striped socks and this red-collared shirt she had saved for me. 
She asked about everything in detail: how the Didkuras treated me
if they hit me, or starved me. 
Has it been a long time, my child, since you've been wearing these old clothes?
Those big-eared ones treat me badly, but how could I tell my mother anything bad about them?
When she saw my torn clothes, she scolded my father: “You heartless man, why did you give our child to others, 
why are you letting him be worked to death?” Tears as big as hazelnuts rolled down her cheeks and filled her lap. 
I felt sorry for myself and began to cry too.
My mother washed my clothes, mended my coat, and polished my shoes before sending me back. 
I hadn’t tasted fresh bread in a long time, but my mother baked me a cake, borrowing flour from our neighbors, and fried it in butter for me. 
I felt revived at home and didn’t want to go back to the sheep. 
Why did my father give me away as someone else’s child? 
The Didkuras never let me go to weddings or feasts... 
“Your feast is with the sheep,” they’d say. 
I remember the girls dancing in red dresses, my peers celebrating, singing, and my heart breaks...
Wolves are a terrible scourge. 
I wish I had a gun to scare them away.
I begged my mother to buy me bullets and ask my father to lend me his gun. 
She promised, but I don’t know if she’ll keep her promise. 
If I get a gun, I’ll take revenge on the ibexes and grouse that don’t fear me now, and perch on cliffs, kicking sand, and the grouse that flutter before me – let’s see if they dare when I’m armed! 
When I was home, the priest’s son, Vaso, came over. 
He told me that there are plenty of bullets in the city. If only I had some... 
Oh, if only I were educated too! 
Vaso told me so many things he had seen and heard. 
Though my grandfather says it’s all nonsense, Vaso laughed and said, “Then why hasn’t it melted till now?”
Vaso was well-dressed: he wore a choka, a colorful shirt, a silver belt, and dagger. 
His father bought him a rifle.
Who would buy me anything? 
When I grow up, I’ll buy everything for myself: plenty of bullets, a silver-plated rifle, and a silver-embroidered choka... 
Vaso gave me a bullet, but I wasted it shooting at a target. 
Vaso has a good heart. 
If I had caught the grouse my Kursha caught yesterday, I would have given it to Vaso. 
Why do I need it?
Why should it die in vain? 
Although it’s sitting in a basket now, my grandfather doesn’t care for it and doesn’t feed it...
Poor thing! 
How it trembled, its heart pounded when I first held it.
A hawk was chasing it. 
Hearing the thunderous call
I turned and saw it: the grouse in front, the hawk behind
both heading towards me.
I was sitting by the water, whittling a reed flute. 
The scared grouse fell into the puddle in front of me
Kursha pounced and caught it. 
The hawk screamed in anger and flew high into the sky. 
I picked up the grouse. 
Poor thing! 
It trembled and tried to escape, looking around in fright
it seemed more at peace last night, sleeping with its eyes closed, huddled up.
Last year, Kursha did something even more amazing.
Once, I was driving the sheep down a rocky path. 
The grass was wet from the rain that night. 
I was already wet, and got even wetter.
The sun was just starting to paint the mountain peaks red. 
I sat on a rock, waiting for the sun to rise. 
In front of me stood a birch tree... 
Suddenly, an eagle appeared
proud and majestic, moving slowly. 
Two crows were harassing it
diving at it, and calling “kra, kra.” 
The eagle didn't pay attention to the ravens and didn't flinch from their attacks. 
It intermittently shrugged its shoulders and moved sideways.
One raven was particularly troublesome. 
The eagle got annoyed and struck fiercely; the raven, with its wings spread, fell headlong, leaving a trail of feathers behind. A gust of wind carried one of its feathers skyward. 
The eagle didn't pay attention to that; it kept moving steadily on its own, gazing at the chasms. 
The second raven then stepped back. 
The eagle crossed the ravine and disappeared from sight.
Now, from behind the ridge, an osprey appeared
carrying a bone in its claws. It played with the bone: dropping it on the ground and swooping down to grab it again. It flew higher, dropped the bone, and followed it down. 
Several times it dropped the bone and picked it up again. 
Soon, it came close to me but didn’t see me, hidden by the birch tree. Kursha lay beside me. 
The tails of the buzzards are rocky and gravelly the eagle preferred the gravel for its bone. 
God got angry and the osprey dropped the bone nearby.
Kursha darted out and grabbed it before the osprey could. 
Angered, the osprey hissed like a snake and quickly disappeared into the rocks.
Later, I asked my grandfather: “What was the osprey doing, grandpa?” 
He told me: “When an osprey can’t break a bone with its beak to eat the marrow, it drops it on the rocks from high up to crack it open and then eats the marrow.” 
Praise be to God, even birds have such wisdom!
Bless you, mountains, for having so many wonderful sights! 
In spring, when the snow melts, I’ll gather berries and herbs from the slopes and cook them in milk.
Is there anything more delicious? 
It’s also the time for lambing. 
I can’t sleep day and night from the joy. 
The bleating of lambs and ewes fills the air... 
But, ah! After these two years, the Didkuras will send me home empty-handed. How can I face my mother without bringing her even a single pelt?
