I am the grass of the mountain, growing on the side of a large cliff.
No other plant can thrive next to me. 
My fate is written only for me: Rock, be your father and mother, your destiny and fortune, your past and future!  
Rock! Are you truly my father and mother, my protector and guardian?  
I am, do not be afraid, little dark one.  
Around me, firmly embedded stones are tightly wedged. 
Who knows how deep their roots go
some of them ignore me, as if I do not exist; they stare into the abyss. 
What are they looking for
what have they lost there? 
They won't tell me, no matter how many times I ask
they think of something, their thoughts are boundless, their hearts' desires are unfathomable. 
Sometimes the cliff sighs, perhaps troubled by some sorrow. 
Otherwise, my mother is unyielding and strong-hearted; it is not afraid of the avalanche, which, in winter, crashes down on us with thunder, comes and falls into the abyss with a roar, lands heavily and sighs as if it has found peace. 
Sometimes the cliff even cries.
I cry too, when I see my mother's tears. 
My mother mourns her fallen children, who are always before her eyes
no matter how much she wants, she cannot look away. 
The cliff's children are the stones lying below, torn from the cliff's bosom, ripped from its chest...  
Look, how heartbreakingly they gaze up at their parents from below, as if begging, why don't you take us up there, why aren't we close to you? 
Their plea, their prayer would be in vain, even if they could wish for it; but what can they do. 
I too look down at them and sprinkle dew drop by drop. 
For them, this is extremely pleasing.  
If only I had one friend, I would talk to them sometimes. 
God bless the flowers looking at me from the other mountain slope. 
They murmur sweetly, sing sweetly in soft, low voices
they too, like me, are unfortunate, longing for the sun. 
Lovely sun, how far you are from me, but still, how you pierce my heart!  
How much I adore you, I gaze at you with longing, I cannot take my eyes off you for a moment
I love you so much, and you do not even look at me once to revive my dead, burning heart; you look at the sun, you love it. 
The sun is the sun's lover. 
From east to west, it follows it with its eyes and face
when the sun sets, it weeps, grieves the separation from its beloved. 
The sun's crying makes me cry too. 
Yesterday, I think, it looked at me too. 
No, it is pure, innocent, and I am ugly and sinful. 
Shouldn't I be covered in blood and filth?! 
This is all the fault of that old eagle nesting next to me. 
As soon as it wakes up in the morning, it starts its terrifying cawing, threatening someone, flashing its huge, bloodthirsty eyes and then it goes off to hunt; all the birds give way to it. 
It brings its prey, sits on a favorite stone above me, tears it apart, the blood drips down and stains me. 
Where can I hide? 
I am smeared red with blood, then the sun looks down and dries the blood on my body. 
Surely it is because of this blood that the sun avoids looking at me, otherwise, it would have called out to me once: Grass! Child of the cliff, greetings to you!  
I love this flower... 
you call it sun because its face and eyes are always turned towards the sun, it loves the sun
just as a child's eyes follow its mother and try not to hide from her, so does this one. 
The sun is the mother, the flower is the sun's child.  
Who knows if I love the sun?
What kind of love is this? I cannot go to it, it cannot come to me, we cannot kiss each other. 
Such love is a pleasant torment. 
I impatiently wait for dawn, then I will see my beloved. 
When winter comes, my heart will darken and the sun will sink into the earth. 
If only I too could melt away, so that maybe one part of me could meet it face to face. 
Spring will come, the sun will revive and so will I. 
I forget the moss and mold hanging over me, I feel like the sun and crazily say: I adore you, beautiful, I adore you!  
If only I knew where the flowers go in winter? 
I think this is called death. 
Who taught me the word death? 
This stone next to me, with its nose raised and staring grimly at the world. This and that two-hundred-year-old eagle. 
No, death cannot be good. 
Yesterday that restless old eagle swallowed a pheasant. Above me, how the poor thing groaned, and it mercilessly tore it apart with its diamond beak.  
Grass, miserable, that is called death! â€“ whispered the stone to me. 
I cried out of pity for the pheasant. 
If that is indeed death, it cannot be good...  
Once I saw a terrible sight, it looked like death too.
Down below, where the great field can be seen, that is where it happened. 
From two sides, from two directions, a crowd of people appeared. 
They were all beautiful, beautifully dressed
they sat on horses gracefully, riding towards each other swiftly.
Because of the distance, I couldn't hear what they were saying. 
They clashed with each other, the glare of weapons was so bright it burned my eyes. 
They threw each other off horses, trampled, struck with swords.  
Finally, as if shrouded in fog, they all disappeared. 
When the fog cleared, evening was approaching. 
I saw the riders lying on the field with their horses, lifeless, like these stones. 
This scene was sad for me and I cried.
They had lost their beauty and grace. 
This saddened me and made me cry.  
Sun, look at me! 
Rain, drench me! 
High cliff, protect my roots
do not take away my life
do not uproot me
do not throw me out!  
Sun, beautiful, lovely! 
Grant me your smile once in a thousand days! 
I am poor, miserable grass, have pity on me!
Mountain wind, life-giving spirit of nature! 
Blow on me, cool my burning heart!  
Eagle, majestic bird! 
If you believe in God, try not to show my eyes the innocent blood you shed; do not let my ears hear their groans, for their groans are my groans, my heart's sigh and sorrow. 
Creator, protect me, preserve the grass hanging on the barren cliff!
