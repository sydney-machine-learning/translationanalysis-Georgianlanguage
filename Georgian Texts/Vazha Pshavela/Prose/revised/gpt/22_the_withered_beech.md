I, like everyone else, love high mountains adorned with green and flowers; the scent of spring, the newly sprouting grass that emerges innocently and harmlessly, triumphing over the recently melted ice, gazing at the sun and the world, shrinking and becoming quiet, yet spreading an indescribable affection on its delicate face.
“I have come to life, thanks to my Creator,” it seems to murmur. 
It is delightful when the frozen trees in the warmth of spring leaf out and others bloom. 
What can compare to the misty, dense, dark, and overgrown forest! 
But now I forget everything and see only one dry beech tree before my eyes. 
It stands in the dense forest, on the top of a cliff. 
This cliff is covered with velvet-like green moss. 
Other trees stand far from the dry beech, as if deliberately distancing themselves and proudly looking down on it. 
Near the dry beech, a few raspberry bushes have grown, with leaves nibbled by deer and elk. 
They lean out and peer down at the river, at its roots, a few licorice plants grow, green all year round with serrated leaves, showing signs of life on the dry beech. 
Only three branches remain, with the upper trunk broken off and fallen into the ravine. 
On these three branches, only three or four leaves sprout each year, pale, withered, and yellowed. 
The other trees, if you look at them, stand laden with nature’s bounty. 
They pay no heed to the dry beech, ignore it, only in winter, when they too shed their bridal garments, and, somewhat closer to the dry beech, do they glance at it, and that only fleetingly… 
This happens exactly when the “Mother of the Place,” with a clear face and flowing hair, tells a tale about love, purity, and life to comfort nature. 
Then they murmur to the dry beech: “Why are you standing so still, poor thing? Listen to what she is saying!” 
The dry beech groans deeply and neither good nor bad listens to the proud plants, but the “Mother of the Place's” tale it listens to; each of her words strikes its heart like a dagger, silently shedding tears.
Poor beech! 
There was a time when it stood proudly, towering above other trees, its large branches and leaves covering the entire forest like a roof. 
The eagle, coming from the mountain to the valley, rested on its top, crowing proudly. 
Now it is near death, ready to fall.
Several places on its body have shed their dry bark, revealing bare sides. 
In one place, the bark hangs down more extendedly, stretched towards the earth; it looks like a dagger has been stuck in and its entrails have been spilled out. 
This beech has many worms, whenever I pass by it, I always see a woodpecker on it. 
This impending fall always perches on it and with all its might, pecks at the dry, doomed tree with its beak; it also screeches and cries, as if giving a signal. 
In many places, it has hollowed out the beech to its heart. 
Soon it will start hollowing out its heart too. 
The beech stands, stands unperturbed, unflinchingly; neither good nor bad does it say. 
When the wind blows, other trees sway, only the dry beech does not move; once, when it was healthy, full of life, at the blowing of the wind, it would start to sway like the sea; its branches and leaves would make a thunderous noise. 
The dry beech's branches proudly struck the earth, crashing, indeed, now the dry beech cannot follow the wind like other trees, it can no longer stand against the storm like before. 
It does not bend, but if it breaks, what can be said… 
It will break, fall, lie down on its side, its roots will be exposed, pointing upwards as if praying, pleading to God for help. 
In summer, the dry beech is more pitiful. 
Other trees are adorned with green leaves, unscathed, carefree. 
On them, a thousand birds perch to sing, doves coo on their branches, the golden bird sings endlessly, the sparrow whistles around them, hopping restlessly; the deer and elk shade under them. 
These leafy trees look down proudly at the poor dry beech, find it unsightly and say: “If only you didn't make us look bad!”
They do not know that the dry beech is remembered more than them and there are people who like and love the unfortunate dry beech… 
In the village, at least three times a day they remember the dry beech, – where did you graze the cattle today? – if a father asks his children, they point to the area around the dry beech, upstream or downstream, at the head or foot.
“A tiger has made its den at the foot of the dry beech,” the rumor goes in the village: “it has cubs.” 
Hunters have seen the mother tiger and her cubs' tracks around the dry beech.
“I will pick mushrooms from the dry beech,” says another.
Indeed, the foolish trees do not know that the people have not forgotten the name of the dry beech, they still remember its greatness.
Is everything that is dry to be despised by man?  
Many a living thing is much less than one dead.  
Seeing you, desolate one, fills my heart with intense sorrow, seeing you so pitiable and orphaned. 
As if a mourning bell has tolled.  
I want to share your sorrow, tears to flow like a river.  
Why have you come, poor thing, not to be mourned dead?!  
For you, there is no destruction, no salvation anywhere!  
Who will close your coffin?
Who will light your candle?...  
Alas
How hard it is, to be dying, for your name to be lost!
At night, once in a thousand times, an owl perches on the dry beech and begins to call with a wounded voice: “Couldn’t you find it?” and when it hears in reply: “No, couldn’t,” it hangs its head and mutters softly, “hoo, hoo,” to its heart.  
In winter, a wolf visits the dry beech.
Sits beside it, and howls, troubled by hunger. 
The dry beech stands unperturbed, says neither bad nor good, stands still.
it knows neither pity nor hatred 
its heart does not boil for friendship or enmity
The dry beech thinks of itself, the past, the present, and the future
Its sorrow seems deeply embedded in its heart. 
Sometimes it looks at a small shoot growing from the end of one of its roots, waiting for the sun and rain to grow. 
This is its only comfort…
