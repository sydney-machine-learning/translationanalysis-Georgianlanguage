Unmoved, firmly, with a grim face, the cliff stands. 
It stands the same throughout winter and summer. 
This cliff is an entire mountain turned into rock, facing the sky, the sun, and the world below. 
At first glance, it seems ugly and irregular, rough, and unorganized with its jumbled rocks: blackened in some places, yellowed in others, elsewhere blue, scratched, scarred, eroded, and furrowed by torrents and streams. 
You look and look at it carefully, and it seems beautiful, like a warrior who has gone through a thousand battles, wounded and damaged in a thousand places, but still standing brave, proud, and determined, watching and fighting. 
It is strong and vigilant because it always stands alert, always gazing intently in one direction: perhaps waiting for an enemy from there.
Two kinds of sorrow pierce the cliff's heart: one is the sky, the other is the valley. 
It gazes at the valley, the beautiful, open fields spread out. 
The valley appears to the mountain as resting peacefully, lying down to sleep. 
This breaks the cliff's heart: why doesn't it stand as I do, always on its feet, always alert? 
It curses the valley's useless wealth. 
It loves the valley, constantly gazing at it, never satisfied with its love, wanting to go and embrace it
but it cannot overcome its nature of being a cliff, it cannot go. 
Not once has the poor thing tasted the sweetness of love. 
This has hardened it more, broken its heart further, but love has grown a thousand times stronger in the cliff's heart. 
How deeply it wishes to pick a single rose or violet from its beloved's bosom. 
It soothes its hopeless love by asking the eagles, its nurtured children, for news of the valley when they return from their travels and sit on its lap...
Poor cliff, poor cliff! 
I understand, I understand your state, your heart's answer. 
You are indeed a cliff, you cannot abandon your nature as a cliff, you cannot break down because you are a cliff... 
Yes, the eagles circle above their parent, telling it: on such and such a day blood was shed in the valley, on such and such a day love blossomed there...
The cliff weeps at night when no one can see or scorn it. 
Its tears exceed those of the sky. 
It does not shed as many tears as it could, fearing the valley might flood. 
No one knows this, so they say: "It's a cliff, it's strong, what does it know of crying, what sorrow can conquer it?" 
The mountains listen to the cliff's weeping with their heads bowed, and wear the black clouds as helmets of their dark thoughts. 
A wise man, hanging on the cliff's edge, heartbroken, listens to his mother's weeping and responds, but his voice is swallowed by the cliff's wails. 
The eagles, not touched by sorrow, understand the cliff's pain from its weeping and hide their heads under their wings. 
The moon is the first to meet the cliff, and it too, looking over its top, murmurs: "Why do you weep, why, my poor friend?"
The cliff's tears run down its face, washing its heart and chest, and flow downward with sobs. 
It goes on weeping: I am the tear of the cliff, nature, the essence of its sorrow; the gathering of flowers on your breast is nurtured by my dew.
The valley too inquires about the cliff, and the tear tells it: It stands firm, sister, as always, in its stony, cliff-like way, though at last your longing has taught it to cry.  
Otherwise, it is well, whole in head, heart, and base.  
What fortress, built with lime mixed with milk, can compare to it, so firmly and grimly gazing?
The valley gathers the cliff's tear to its heart, absorbing it. 
When the eagles tell this, the cliff finds some rest. 
Not only the cliff groans and weeps: someone else groans within the cliff's heart, trapped in darkness. 
Excessive sorrow has dried his tears, or he has wept so much that his tears have run out. 
The cliff has no trouble
it sees the sky, the sun, the earth, but this soul groans within the cliff's heart, deprived of everything but suffering. 
Bound by a thick chain, gloomy, covered with moss on his beard and body... 
No one hears his groans but the cliff. 
His sword stands upright before him, his club lies nearby. 
Seeing them, his heart dies even more. 
Once he used them, but now they are rusting with him. 
Day changes to day, night to night, the sun rises and sets, but this man finds no relief; 
centuries follow centuries, and there is no help, no salvation for him...
Who is the rescuer of this hero? 
No one. 
Only his loyal dog
tirelessly licking the chain throughout the year, and when it nearly breaks, the blacksmith strikes the anvil and the chain becomes whole again. 
The hopeless Amiran groans, the cliff trembles and whispers: "Do not break, do not lose hope. 
See how many storms pass over me and I still stand firm."
At night, sprites gather at the foot of the cliff and sing: Angels grieve, we love to see others in torment. 
Suffer, for you are suffering,  
why did you drive the devils from their lair?!  
You created a sea of blood for the devils, you made heaps of corpses.  
Your sword cut equally through their bodies and armor.  
Now go to Darejan and her sister Tina.  
Do not be satisfied with groans, Amiran, beg the dog: lick and break the chain, reach the sword with your hand... 
Seeker of good for the land, your glory has worn out.  
Groan a thousand times more, you have not yet endured enough, drink the bitterness of your life's days.
When the sprites finish their song, a bird peeks out from the cliff's crevice, bringing light with it, and calls out to the sprites: May the high God of the Trinity curse you, that Amiran's suffering may not warm you with guilt.  
You will see Amiran again with a sword in hand, clad in armor, chasing and scattering you with his mighty arm.
