In a meadow surrounded by dense forest, there was a great commotion. 
Men, women, children, and dogs were mingling like a swarm of bees! 
The majority were armed people. 
Everyone's face was glowing with pleasure and happiness, everyone had a smile on their lips; people were gathered around a fallen stag, which had been killed by hunters that morning. 
The forest's child lay wordlessly, having grown strong and free in the heart of the forest; its eyes, now lifeless, floated like murky water; its tongue hung out.
The hunters' horses, seeing the dead stag, snorted and turned away, not wanting to look at the dead deer
and so they grazed on the green grass at the end of the field, their bridles dragging. 
The children, who at first had not dared to approach the deer, now clung to its antlers.
"Hurry up and skin it, hurry!" urged the women
"Let's see how good the venison kebab will taste!"
Someone called out: "Come on, ladies, while the kebab is cooking, let's breathe the air, get our blood flowing, we'll enjoy it more. 
Come on, let's go, while the kebab is cooking, daira, doli, and diplipito!"
"That would be great, really great," chattered a man with big mustaches and he was the first to start dancing, leaping like a lively bull in a meadow
he was the first to greet the sound of the daira and diplipito. 
Others followed him, dancing on the green, enjoying life. 
Some were too busy skinning the deer. 
Killing the deer increased their joy tenfold; they had all longed for this; they had come to the field to kill a deer or a roe, and they succeeded. 
Their hearts' desire was fulfilled; today, everyone present was happy. 
Only the forest and the surrounding nature were not happy; the forest wept, the great slopes and the mountain's skirts, which looked down on the meadow where the stag was being skinned, wept. 
The black forest-covered hills poured sighs and groans, carried by the wind, over the meadow where the stag lay.
The old trees – lindens, oaks, poplars, hornbeams, aspens, beeches, birches, and others, all lamented, having learned of the death of their beloved child. 
The forest is the deer's mother; the forest nursed it, rocked its cradle, and covered it with a blanket. 
The forest rejoiced and cared for the stag, proud of raising such a strong, beautiful child.
The deer's beauty was interwoven with the forest's own beauty. 
The deer's beauty confirmed the forest's beauty. 
Can something ugly and hideous produce beauty? 
In the deer, the forest saw itself. 
The deer was the forest's pride. 
Tell me, did the forest ever begrudge the deer anything it could see or touch? 
The deer roamed the impenetrable forest as its rightful owner; this pleased the forest, it never resented it: it wanted its child, its nurtured one, to stand as a handsome, strong, intelligent, and renowned warrior.
The deer's goodness was the forest's goodness, just as a child's virtue is always a parent's pride.
"Alas, my joy, 
alas, my pride! 
Light would fill my heart when it passed by and gazed at me with its beautiful, innocent eyes," said the moss-covered rock intertwined with the roots of oak and beech.
The deer's companions, unable to mourn
ran away in fright, concerned for their own lives. 
Even the rustle of a thrush in the forest seemed like death to them. 
They darted their eyes here and there, pricking up their ears, sharpening their senses. 
They sniffed the wind; the scent of a human frightened them more than that of a wolf...
The forest wept...
In the shadow of the great oaks, a long table was laid, bordered by rows of people – men and women. 
There was eating and drinking, a great feast, the clinking of glasses, songs of "Mralalali" and "Varkhalali" were heard. 
Singing was followed by dancing, laughter, and merriment.
The sun tilted westward; evening was approaching; the hunters prepared to go home; the women packed up into the wagon; the young men mounted their horses. 
They tried to carry their rifles as neatly as possible; every turn they made silently expressed: 
"We are the hunters who killed the game, very skillful with the rifle, and thus fine fellows!"
The hunters returned home satisfied and cheerful. 
The field remained deserted, with only the traces of a campfire where an hour ago the fire blazed, and venison kebabs were being roasted on wooden skewers. The long table was laid, and the laughter and merriment of men and women could be heard. 
Here and there lay the gnawed bones of the deer, first gnawed by human teeth, then by dogs.
The forest wept and said: "Alas, my renowned child, Borjov, when will I ever raise another child like you, adorned with antlers and stature; I was proud of you, and from now on, whom shall I be proud of?"
The forest mourned and shed tears.
