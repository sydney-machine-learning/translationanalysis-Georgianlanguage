It was summer. 
The mountain was green. 
Snow was only visible at the peaks, and in the ravines, there were avalanches. 
Shepherds had driven their sheep and cows to the mountains for summer grazing, but they were cursing their fate: a plague had struck, and countless sheep and cows were dying. 
They couldn't keep up with the flaying; blood streams were added to many of the water streams. 
In the ravines, around the shelters and pens, carcasses lay everywhere. 
It was a blessed time for birds and beasts
enormous vultures, ravens, eagles, and crows were feasting. Satiated, their beaks and claws stained with blood, they sat on the nearby cliffs, smearing the rocks and moss with blood.
A satiated vulture sat atop a cliff. 
It was barely able to breathe from fullness but rolled its eyes more bravely and greedily stared at the pile of carcasses in the abyss. 
"Ha, ha, ha!" it laughed finally, "Look, just look at that fool, that wretch, that worm, that poor thing! 
If only it could become a mouthful and then dare to speak ill of me, then let it be cursed. 
God shame me, weigh us on the scales, brother, if I don't outweigh two thousand nightingales. 
When I soar in the air, spreading my wings, I can be seen from a thousand versts away by the human eye, but that fool, if it doesn't stick its head out
no one can see it; no one has seen it flying, apparently it crawls in the bushes, chirping something, and for that, they praise it. 
It chirps while asleep, with its eyes closed. 
It is not even equal to my eyes, which never close and are always ready for food and prey. 
It chirps and chirps, never thinking of food and drink, and also curses me, shouting curses at me..."
"Cra-a-nt, cra-a-nt!" came the sound. A black crow was approaching the vulture. 
It played with the vulture, who was sitting proudly, flapped its wing on its wing, wanting to get it to stand up, but the vulture, heavy with fullness, couldn't be moved from its place, so the crow settled nearby and perched on the cliff.
"Crow, crow!" the vulture turned to the crow and began to speak haughtily: "How are you? What were you telling me the other day about the nightingale, singing beautifully? 
I wish I were a nightingale! 
Foolish, brainless!"
"Yes, I was telling you the same thing: I will never forget its singing as long as I live, and you won't believe it, hearing its song was even better than this pile of carcasses."
"How was it, how? Tell me again!" asked the vulture.
"It sang beautifully, beautifully! 
I've been satiated with carcasses, with the flesh of various animals and birds
but I've never experienced such a moment of pleasure in my life; when I listened to the nightingale's singing, my heart began to beat, I could hear its thumping and noise myself. It didn't stop all night, it didn't rest. 
The whole meadow was just it and me."
"What were you doing in the meadow at night?" said the vulture irritably.
"Before the carcasses appeared in the mountains, I used to roam the valley for food. 
I found a lot of provisions before God. 
I was lazy to go up to the mountains and spent a night in the meadow on a huge branch. 
That night I heard what I've never heard in my life, and maybe I'll never hear the nightingale's voice again. 
Tonight, maybe I'll go again, I'm not hungry or anything. 
I'll go, sit on the same branch, and listen to its singing, and in the morning I'll come back here. 
On the same tree, on another branch, a raven was sitting. 
Although it was in a bad mood, it translated every word for me
I only liked the voice, I didn't understand the words. 
The raven knew the nightingale's language well and translated it for me in detail. 
Don't you know, it lives in the valley all year round and easily learned it."
"What did it translate for you, why don't you tell me?" said the vulture again.
"Many things, who can count! I couldn't learn them all," the crow told him.
"I remember a few things. 
This is what the nightingale sang: 'Come, flowers, beautiful, lovely, angels of the earth, I adore you, I worship you. 
Without you, God, don't give me a single day's life, you are, you are my life. 
Forest, crown of the earth, always rejoice with leaves and fruits, always be green, always be cheerful and I, your poor poet, will sing to you, praise and glorify your beauty, your creator. 
May your purity never be stained with any sin, so you don't make me weep bitterly, don't break my heart!
"Springs, flowing pure and clear! 
Nature flows like milk, so that every creature may quench its thirst, water the plants prepared to wither and dry, make them grow, flourish, lift their heads 
don't forget, for your sake, the last worm, the last caterpillar, because it too longs for life. 
Don't dry up: flow, babble. 
When I see you, my heart feels pure emotions and great love like you. 
Lord, God, bless the springs, bless the flowers, bless the forest, I bow to your grace and glory!
"Sun, comforter of all beings, warm and rejoice everyone with your blessed rays, but don't burn, don't wither, don't spoil the work of man and nature's right hand; you, heavenly wind, help the sun, mix together and sow grace on earth! 
Powers of nature, gather with me, listen to my plea: here are the villages, here are the huts, there orphans, wretches, and poor people are crying. 
Help them, make the weepers laugh, satiate the hungry with your power and grace! 
Ah, the poor ones! 
How many are crying
how many are sighing
and their tears are like a sea in my heart, suffocating my soul, poisoning my life.
"How many shepherds cry 
and vultures and crows, vile, ungrateful, wicked birds, who feed on others' tears, cawing on others' graves. 
Their memory nauseates and poisons me." 
And so on.
"What? Vultures and crows?" said the vulture angrily
"Curse its sun, the vulture and crow are its relatives, they chirp like it and cannot enjoy the pleasures of this world. 
What god cursed you that you didn't immediately jump on it and crush its head, that scoundrel, that wretch, that thing! 
How much would I have spoken about myself if I were there?!
My life wouldn't be worth living if I didn't tear it in half right away!"
"If it had said it directly in dry words, I would have done the same, but it said it so beautifully and gracefully that I froze, my claws stuck to the tree branch, my beak became rigid, it enchanted me, weakened me. 
I'm sure if you were in my place, you wouldn't have made a sound, you wouldn't have moved a muscle. 
Not only would I not have torn it apart, but tonight I must go there again and listen to the nightingale's song, and if you want, you can come too. 
You take out your anger on it. 
It's easy to kill, to catch it. It always sings with its eyes closed; in the morning I saw it myself, its eyes were closed, and it was lamenting."
"I will come," said the vulture, "and I will punish it today, I will show you its trick."
"Let's see, come then, let's go!" said the crow. 
"Cra-a-nt," it was heard, the crow flew off
and the vulture flapped after it, and they flew off together.
Darkness fell when the two of them, the crow and the vulture, landed on a large branch in a large meadow, settled heavily, and calmly folded their wings.
It got quite dark. 
The crow, wide-eyed, neck stretched, waited impatiently for the nightingale to start singing. 
The vulture, however, slumped down disgracefully, its beak closed, wings spread, looking like a white sack on the branch.
"Why isn't it singing, where has that scoundrel gone?" said the vulture irritably
"Call out to it, at least make it make a sound."
"Be patient, just a little longer, be patient," answered the crow
"If I call out, will it hear, and who knows if it will sing under compulsion?!"
After a while, they heard a sound, almost like a groan.
"There, there, it started, it started!" said the happy crow
"Listen, that's it, it's singing, it started, now you can take out your anger!"
The groan was followed by a tinkling, slowly, slowly, steadily, and finally, the divine voice rose.
The vulture lifted its head and opened its eyes. 
It shuffled. 
Midnight approached. 
The nightingale was singing, and the vulture said, "Oh, oh, oh, it indeed pierces the heart, crow!"
Dawn came, twilight met light, the crow stared at the vulture and noticed that two tears clung to the wretched bird's eyes, and it was gloomy.
"Well, uncle, what are you going to do
kill it if you can
why are you so still, so silent?" said the crow proudly.
"I got lost in thought, my thoughts carried me away. 
I no longer want what I promised."
"Didn't I tell you, you wouldn't dare do anything to it? 
Do you remember?"
"I remember, and you weren't wrong," said the vulture with a sigh.
It was noon when the vulture and the crow sat side by side in the big ravine, pecking at a carcass.
