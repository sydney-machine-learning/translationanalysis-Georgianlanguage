Do not be afraid, we are not snakes. 
What would a snake be doing on this high mountain? 
You were frightened for nothing, we do not harm people, we do not poison them. 
The shriveled, dry bark that covers us from the outside scared you? 
There was a time when we had a different color and appearance. 
Time and the conditions of the era have changed our face, and now, when a shepherd or a hunter stumbles upon us, they must be startled until they see us up close and realize that we are just the dead roots of an oak and nothing more. 
Once, we nourished a huge oak, providing it with sustenance, feeding it. 
The oak boasted proudly, standing tall because of our sweat and effort. 
We were also proud of raising such a beautiful, unyielding, proud child.
“Both you and your oak desired my strength and my support,” the earth has often told us; but we would kneel and humbly ask for sustenance for our beloved child. 
We devoted day and night to ensuring it was well-fed.
We encouraged each other with these words: "Let’s make sure it lacks nothing, let’s try." 
Rest, earth, rest.
We will not trouble you anymore. 
The one we cherished and pleaded for is no longer with us, we are withering, what use is sustenance for the dead and dry? 
Man, the unmerciful human, killed our heart, killed our child, and left us in tears. 
He took an ax and began to chop it; he did not hear our and our child's groans.
When the ax strikes us, we groan, but you, humans, call this "chopping sound." 
Our blood flows, and you call it "tree sap." 
Just because we do not extend a hand, scratch anyone's face, curse, or chase the attacker with a menacing look, does that mean we feel nothing?! 
"Chopping the oak," a man would tell his friend as if it were nothing. 
He did not see that we quietly shed tears underground, and our sin and suffering made the earth cry too: "Poor things," it would murmur, "why did you toil? 
Who appreciates my work
who says thank you?!" 
The earth would say this, but at the same time, it would offer nourishment to the distant, sprouting roots of beech, birch, and poplar.
This blessed one from God refuses no one. 
She is the mother of all, she cares for everyone, all lie on her back. 
Blessed be your bosom, our mother, our nurturer, our feeder! 
But what can the poor one do? 
Fate has also turned against her.
Yesterday and today we cried a lot, we regret leaving the place where we were born, raised, and felt life. 
Who knows what awaits us?! 
Our dwelling is crumbling day by day, becoming barren, and we are left roofless, naked, and hungry.
Eventually, we will break off and fall headlong, we will descend into the dense gorge. 
Who knows what awaits us there? 
Who knows what ground we will find there? 
Will we perish completely, or will the earth cover us and provide sustenance again?! 
Who knows, the raging river might cast us onto some desolate place and the scorching sun might wither us, dry us, and erase our memory! 
God, do not abandon us! 
Fate, do not betray us. 
Earth, give us a home again! 
We thirst for life and labor
we want to work again, maybe we will raise another child on our roots, maybe we will feel joy again. 
Forces of nature, heed the plea of the poor roots.
