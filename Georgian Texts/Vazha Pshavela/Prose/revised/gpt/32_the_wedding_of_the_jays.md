This story took place in a large, dark, dense forest, far removed from villages and cities. 
What kind of story is it, you ask? 
It's about the wedding of chaffinches. 
Chaffinch Zakara was marrying the beautiful and exceedingly clever chaffinch Ketevan. 
The elderly chaffinch Thomas officiated the ceremony.
Thomas raised his eyes to the heavens and solemnly said, “Bless, O Lord, their union, instill in them mutual love and loyalty, may they multiply like fish in the water and stars in the sky, and keep the bed of your servant Zakara and maidservant Ketevan undefiled. 
Amen.” With this, he placed a crown of beautiful flowers on each of their heads. 
“Amen!” “Amen!” echoed around them. This was the chorus of the guests: chaffinches, linnets, pipits, nuthatches, jays, pheasants, creepers, woodpeckers, turtle doves, thrushes, and many others.
There was no room left, so many guests had gathered. 
The flowers themselves were pleased to be invited to the wedding. 
Nearby, a cold, clear stream flowed. 
The table was long and laden with all sorts of food and fruits. 
Every kind of seed and insect was brought for the feast – a buffet of grass seeds and a variety of bugs.
The bride and groom were invited to sit on a throne covered in flowers, and the guests lined up in rows.
A great feast began, with all sorts of drinks being consumed. Red Kakhetian wine flowed like water on the table. 
Everyone toasted the bride and groom and presented them with gifts.
A woodpecker was perched on a branch in a hollow and sang a “many years” blessing.  
“Hey, you noisy one, why aren’t you drinking wine, friend? What will happen? Drink the wine, go on!” the birds shouted at the woodpecker in unison.  
“Wait a bit, fellows, give me a moment, God bless you. I’ve found a nice, fat worm here, let me dig it out, and then I’ll drink as much wine as you like. I won’t have a worry in the world and can drink in peace,” 
the woodpecker replied and started pecking at the hollow tree with his beak. 
All eyes turned to the woodpecker.  
“Go on, show us your bravery,” the birds called out to the woodpecker. 
“If you don’t get it out, woe to you, we won’t give you any bread, you know.”  
For a long time, the woodpecker’s beak and claws scraped the hollow tree, but it wasn’t for nothing: the woodpecker pulled out a long worm, resembling a small snake, and presented it with his beak to the bride and groom.  
“To the health of the bride and groom!” the woodpecker shouted loudly. 
“Cheers to the company, hurrah!”  
“Cheers, cheers! Hurrah! Well done, woodpecker! 
Bravo for not embarrassing yourself or us,” the birds shouted. 
As a reward for his bravery, the woodpecker was given a full ram’s horn of wine, which he drank without hesitation and tossed the empty horn back to the toastmaster. The toastmaster, the same chaffinch Thomas, was chosen for his role.
“They eat bread and drink wine, but don’t sing a song,” said the crow, and with his beautiful voice, he began a festive tune. 
The other birds provided harmony, and the singing grew so strong that the forest echoed. The mountains and valleys shook. 
The flowers were laughing. 
Nearby, a mouse had its burrow. 
Annoyed by the noise, the mouse peeked out of its burrow.
It watched the birds’ feast and revelry, saw the fat, delicious food, colorful and varied, and swallowed its saliva greedily. 
It watched for a long time, unable to resist. 
“Whatever happens, happens,” it thought, and scampered close, jumping straight onto the table in front of the bride and groom.
“Welcome, whoever you are! Welcome to the mouse!” was the general cry of the birds. 
“Oh, bless you for coming to see us, buddy!” the drunken birds told the mouse.
“Bless you all, may you live long and prosper, always be happy and blessed by the Creator,” 
the mouse said, biting into a hearty nut and slowly crunching it with its teeth.
“Give the mouse some wine, give it wine,” the toastmaster ordered. 
“He needs to catch up to our level.”  
“I don’t drink wine, friends, nuts are better for my eyes. Enjoy yourselves; I’ll be fine with these nuts,” the mouse replied.  
“What do you mean, you don’t drink? Here, drink up, or we’ll pour the wine over your head,” the toastmaster insisted, passing the horn to the woodpecker.
The woodpecker took the horn from Thomas and sat down close to the mouse.  
“Drink, friend, it’s a wedding. What do you mean you won’t drink? If you keep crunching nuts, what kind of order is that? Come on, take the horn from me,” 
the woodpecker said, offering the horn to the mouse.  
“I can’t drink, please, leave me alone, I can’t do it, what should I do?” 
the mouse pleaded, turning away.
“Pour it over him, pour it over this rascal! 
He must drink the bride and groom’s health, you fool!” the toastmaster yelled.  
“I’ve never drunk wine in my life, folks, and now you want to teach me to drink? How can that be? I’m honest, respectable people.
Here, I’ll toast the bride and groom with an acorn,” the mouse said.
“Pour it, pour it on him, force him to drink. 
He must drink
it can’t be otherwise. 
Why else would he come here if not to drink wine?
Pour it, pour it,” the birds insisted.  
The woodpecker grabbed the mouse by the neck with one hand and forced the wine-filled horn to its mouth with the other, making the mouse drink.  
“If it were up to you, I know you wouldn’t drink, but here it’s the toastmaster’s will. 
Look at all these creatures, none refuse to drink wine. You’re the only stubborn one here. 
Come on, drink up, drink up, it’s not right to refuse wine like it’s mother’s milk, you fool,” the woodpecker scolded.
With great effort, the mouse managed to swallow a few drops, its face showing clear distaste for the wine.  
“Drink up, mouse, drink up! Come on, cheers! 
Bravo, buddy!” the birds encouraged the mouse.  
The mouse finally managed to gulp down the wine
though a little spilled on its velvet jacket.  
“Don’t pour wine on my jacket, you fool. Do you think it’s your ragged coat?” the mouse snapped at the woodpecker. 
Then it took a deep breath.
Just one more sip and it shouted: “To the bride and groom! 
Cheers to your bride!”  
“Cheers, cheers! Drink up, drink up!” the delighted voices echoed.  
The wine quickly affected the mouse, and it started singing.
Its chirping voice filled everyone’s ears.
Then it began to dance
making everyone laugh. 
Even the crow joined in, and the two of them danced together. 
The crows held their bellies with laughter, watching the scene.  
“Phew, I’m exhausted,” the mouse said at last, its face and chest covered in sweat. 
It lay down next to the table, its round belly facing the sky, and panted heavily.
At the far end of the table, the nightingale sat quietly. 
The songbird was not rejoicing or laughing; it watched the scene with a somber expression.  
“Beautiful nightingale, why don’t you share your beautiful voice with us?” the birds pleaded with the nightingale. 
The nightingale refused, saying it wasn’t always in the mood to sing, that it was feeling down.  
Finally, the birds’ persistent pleading won over the nightingale, and it began to sing. 
The birds fell silent, even the buzzing of flies could be heard, and the flowers held their breath, gazing at the minstrel with adoring eyes. 
The nightingale sang:
“Glory to you, ruler of the heavens, Glory to you, force of nature, Glory to you, crowned king, And may you too, bride, be blessed!  
I will weave a crown of love, Embroidered with virtue,  
I will not spare anything, I will put everything good in it.  
With a pure heart, I will bestow it upon you, May your heads wear it proudly.  
Love is my heart, If I see it in others, it sets my heart ablaze,  
Today your love is the greatest, And it captivates our hearts and eyes.”
At that moment, a magnificent stag appeared nearby, listening intently to the birds’ singing and the nightingale’s whistling. The nightingale’s song stirred a melancholy in its heart.
Tears welled up in its eyes, it sighed deeply, and turned back into the dense forest.
The birds continued their communal song
each adding their voice in harmony. 
This song painted a picture of nature’s praise, the blessings of the forest and the earth. 
They were expressing their gratitude for these blessings. At that moment, an eagle soared overhead
“Eagle!” “Eagle!” the cry went out: “The king is coming!” 
Suddenly, all the birds fell silent, too afraid to speak. They all trembled and shivered. 
Indeed, the eagle was a fearsome sight: what did it want? 
With one swoop, it could turn the entire flock into dust.
“Why are you trembling, friends? Speak up. Surely the king will not deign to crush us, will he?” said the chaffinch Thomas to the birds
“If you wish, I will invite the king here at this moment.” 
Some birds refused; they said they couldn’t bear the glare of his eyes. They said: “We won’t enjoy ourselves, what’s the point?”
Others agreed, saying: “Invite him, invite him.”
The chaffinch Thomas flew up and fluttered before the king of the birds. 
The eagle continued its flight, as if a fly were buzzing in front of it.  
“Greetings to your majesty, our king,” the chaffinch saluted the eagle.  
“Greetings to the chaffinch,” the eagle replied calmly.  
“Our great king, we humbly invite you to the wedding.
We ask with all our hearts and souls; we beg you on bended knee, your entire flock
if your majesty deigns to grace us with your presence, we will be greatly honored, we will devote ourselves to you.”
“Why not, I’ll come,” the eagle said. “Lead the way!”  
The chaffinch flew down, and the eagle folded its mighty wings and swooped down.
The sight was like the sky falling.
The entire flock of birds rose and greeted their king with a chorus of chirps.
The eagle gave his customary greeting to the gathering.  
They invited the king and seated him at the head of the table.
Everyone stood, hat in hand. 
Only the nightingale was not present.  
“You may sit,” the eagle said, and the birds arranged themselves according to their rank.
This event happened on a Monday.
People who ventured into the forest, whether for work or hunting, were amazed. 
They said: “What’s going on, why are the birds silent, why isn’t a single chirp heard?”
Little did they know that the birds were at the chaffinch’s wedding, enjoying themselves and feasting.  
They served the eagle wine in horns. He drank it without hesitation and became quite merry
he sang a heroic song in his fearsome voice, sending shivers down everyone’s spine.  
“God,” they prayed, “God, don’t let anything upset our king, or he’ll wipe us out in a second.”  
But the eagle did not get angry; he urged the birds to rejoice, sing, and dance
but the birds seemed to have lost their spirit. 
They didn’t know what had come over them.
To give the birds courage, the eagle ordered the horns and drums to be played.  
The order was immediately carried out, and the eagle began to stomp with his mighty talons, trampling almost the entire flower-filled area.
Still, no one dared to dance. Finally, the mouse mustered the courage: it danced such a vigorous dance, kicking up so much dust, that it reached the sky. 
Once, in his enthusiasm and fervor, the mouse even jumped over the eagle’s head. 
The king was a bit annoyed by the mouse’s foolish behavior, but out of politeness and the occasion, he said nothing
only gave it a glare that nearly scared the mouse to death.
Despite this, the mouse became ill after the glare, went and lay under a tree, and covered itself with a dry birch leaf.
Of all the birds, the woodpecker was the boldest. 
He was quite drunk and sang such bawdy songs that the whole mountain and valley shook. 
The woodpecker became so bold that he even taunted the king.  
“Who made you king?” he said to the eagle. “When did we elect you?”  
“Be quiet, you fool, what are you saying, you insolent one?” the birds whispered.  
“I won’t be quiet, why should I? Why?” the drunk woodpecker continued. 
“What kind of people are you? You hate him in your hearts, but can’t say anything to his face. Courage is speaking up.”
The eagle laughed heartily at the woodpecker’s insolence, but the birds were ashamed of the insult to their king. They seized the woodpecker, pierced his beak with a sharp stick, and pinned him to a tree. 
The woodpecker was dismayed and silent, not understanding why he was punished so harshly.
While the birds were engrossed in this, a fox crept up close. 
The sly animal had been watching from the edge of the forest for a long time, waiting for the right moment, thinking: “They’re drunk now, it’s my time.” 
The fox was noticed just as it was about to snatch the bride and groom. 
An uproar ensued, the birds scattered, and the eagle swooped down on the fox, tearing it to shreds in an instant. 
The birds scattered, some perched on trees, others circled high above. 
Only the eagle and the woodpecker remained below; the sick mouse also found a burrow to hide in at the sound of the commotion.
The eagle freed the woodpecker and said: “I forgive you this transgression because you were drunk, but don’t dare do it again, or woe to your hide.” 
Then he flew up, as if to pierce the sky, and began circling above.
Ketevan and Zakara retreated into the dense forest: they spent the day in each other’s arms, kissing and embracing, and fell asleep side by side on a beech branch in the evening.
