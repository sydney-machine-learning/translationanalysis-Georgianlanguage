I have come to the dense forest... 
As long as I am alive, I will grace the forest, the grass, and that rough cliff watching from afar with my beauty. I will spread my fragrance to the surroundings. 
Everyone loves me: look at that rotting stump, its eyes always fixed on me, it smiles sometimes, wanting to come closer, to kiss me, but it cannot; it only smiles at me from a distance, poor thing, though unattractive, a great kindness spreads over its face.
Is it only that which rejoices in my life? 
Even the dead trees support me from above, themselves bare-headed, they cover me with their branches: "Let our violet not get cold, or be harmed by anything." 
They do not let the heavy rain reach me directly: rain can strip me of my leaves at once. 
Being without leaves is the same as death for me. 
No, the trees: birch, beech, hazel, elm, and poplar surround me and guard me, they keep the rain's moisture in their branches and leaves and then slowly drip it onto me, washing my face. 
I lift my head and wish, if only I could sing, if only my creator had given me the gift to praise the high sky and clouds, the sun, these protective trees, these mountains, those meadows, and the chirping birds, which with their red and green feathers dance before me in the dry, yellow leaves and sometimes chirp at me, play with me, rejoicing in my life. 
My one month's life is better than someone else's twenty-four months of life, but I long for a long life. 
This morning, a "beech-bird" sang near me, it was beautiful – red-throated, chirping; it too, like me, admired itself, looking at its chest and shoulders; everyone admires themselves, everyone rejoices in life, everyone loves nature.
Yesterday the sky thundered. Thunder and lightning do not frighten us: thunder heralds rain, and rain nurses us on the heart of the earth. 
The sun is our father, watching over us from above, caressing us, keeping an eye on us. 
The arrival of rain is a joy for plants – they rejoice, their happiness reaching up to their necks.
Now they will don new dresses and finery. 
It has been two days since my dear friend, the daisy, appeared; poor thing, it is so happy, always nodding its head up and down, bowing to the earth and the sunlight, whispering to me, telling me stories about life and love; sometimes it even dances, embraces me, and kisses me. 
Yesterday morning, both my friend and I cried.
How pitiless is man?! 
Whatever he sees, he wants to use for his own benefit. 
Perhaps he does not appreciate our beauty! 
A man passed by us, carrying an axe on one shoulder, a gun on the other. 
He approached a beautiful beech with outstretched branches, struck it with the axe, and felled it. 
Poor tree, when it fell, it groaned. 
Nearby, a wild strawberry plant had emerged and was clinging to the fallen leaves. 
When the tree fell, its leaves scattered and shone red, tears poured into its hollowed-out heart.
At noon, a weary dove came and perched on an alder branch in front of us and began to coo. 
It too was happy about the arrival of spring and the peaceful return to its familiar place. 
Suddenly, a gunshot rang out, the dove fell silent, first hanging by its feet on the branch, then dropping to the ground in front of me. 
Blood flowed from its beak, and it closed its eyes; the spilled blood stained the leaves drop by drop. 
My friend and I shivered... 
I hear nothing clearly, only a murmur, a rumble, a dim clamor reaches me. 
Alas, how pitiful is the violet that came to the mountain!  
The cold will harm the poor thing, or lightning will strike it on the head;  
God has given it a short lifespan.
Its adornment of the world is but a fleeting moment.  
The violet begins to fade, it cries out: "Alas!  
If you created me, Lord, why not give me a long life?"
