I am a blade of mountain grass, growing on the side of a large, steep cliff. No other plant can thrive beside me. Fate has written it exclusively for me: "Oh grass! Let the cliff be your mother and father, your destiny and fortune, your past and future!"
"Oh cliff! Are you truly my mother and father, my protector and guardian?"
"I am, do not be afraid, little dark one."
All around me are tightly packed boulders. Who knows how deep their roots go; some of them don't even pay attention to me, as if I don't exist; they stare into the abyss with wide eyes. What are they looking for, what have they lost there? They won't tell me, even if I ask a thousand times, whatever they're thinking, their thoughts are boundless, their heart's desire is unknowable. Sometimes the cliff sighs, perhaps some sorrow troubles it. Otherwise, my mother is unwavering and strong-hearted; she is not afraid of the avalanche that crashes down on us in winter with thunder and lightning, it comes and falls into the abyss with a roar, and then sighs heavily, as if resting. Sometimes the cliff even cries. I cry then too, because I see my mother's tears. My mother cries for her slain children, who are always before her eyes; even if she wanted to, she couldn't look away from them. The cliff's children are the boulders scattered below, torn from the cliff's breast, ripped from its heart...
Look, how sadly they gaze up at their parents from below, as if pleading, "Why don't you bring us up there, why aren't we near you?" Their pleas, their supplications, would be in vain, even if they could express this longing; but what can they do. I also look down at them and sprinkle them with a few drops of dew. It's very pleasant for them...
I wish I had at least one friend, I could talk to them sometimes. May God help the flowers that look at me from the other side of the mountain. They hum sweetly, they sing sweetly in a soft, low voice; they, like me, are unfortunate, longing for the daisy. Beautiful daisy, how far away you are from me, but how you still touch my heart!
How I long for her, I gaze at her with longing, I can't take my eyes off her for a moment, I love her so much, and she never looks at me, even once, to revive my withered, burnt heart; she gazes at the sun, she longs for it. The daisy is a sun-worshipper. From east to west, she follows it with her eyes and face; when the sun sets, she cries, sad at the separation from her beloved. The daisy's crying makes me cry too. Yesterday, I think, she looked at me too. No, she is pure, innocent, and I am ugly and sinful. Am I not stained with blood and filth?! It's all the fault of that old eagle that nests next to me. As soon as he wakes up in the morning, he starts his terrifying screeching, threatening someone, rolling his big, bloodthirsty eyes, and then he sets off to hunt; all the birds make way for him. He brings his prey, sits on a chosen rock above me, and pecks at it, the blood drips down on me. How can I avoid it? I become red with blood, then the sun looks at me and dries this blood on my body. Blessed be the creator of rain! Sometimes it washes me. Surely the daisy avoids my gaze because of this blood, otherwise, she would have called out to me at least once: "Oh grass! Child of the cliff, greetings to you!"
I love this flower... You humans call it a daisy because its face and eyes are always turned towards the sun, it's a sun-worshipper; just as a child's eyes follow its mother and try not to let the mother out of sight, so does the daisy. The sun is the mother, the daisy is the child of the sun.
Who knows if I love the daisy? But what kind of love is this anyway? I can't go to her, she can't come to me, we can't kiss each other. Such love is a pleasant torment. I eagerly await the dawn, that's when I see my beloved. When winter comes, my heart will also turn black, and the daisy will sink into the ground. I wish I could sink too, so that maybe one part of me could meet hers face to face. Spring will come, the daisy will come to life, and I will come to life too. I forget the moss and lichen clinging to my back, I think I am a daisy and I say like a madman: "Your sacrifice, my beautiful one, your sacrifice!"
I wish I knew where the flowers go in winter? I think they call it death. Who taught me the word death? This rock, the one with its nose sticking out next to me, staring angrily at the world. It and that two-hundred-year-old eagle. No, death must not be good. Yesterday, when that restless old man swallowed a partridge above me, how the poor thing moaned, and he mercilessly tore it apart with his diamond beak.
"Grass, you fool, that's what they call death!" the rock whispered to me. I was crying out of pity for the partridge. If this is really death, it must not be good...
Once I saw a terrifying sight, it also resembled death. Down there, far away, where you can see a large field, this event happened on that field. From two sides, two groups of people appeared. They were all beautiful, dressed beautifully; they sat on horses gracefully, elegantly, and were riding towards each other quickly. Because of the distance, I couldn't hear what they were saying. They clashed with each other, I couldn't bear to look at the flashing of weapons, it was intense. They were throwing each other off horses, stabbing, striking with swords.
In the end, as if a fog had descended, they all disappeared. When the fog cleared, evening was approaching. I saw that the riders, along with their horses, lay lifeless on the field, just like these rocks. This picture was a sad picture for me, and I cried. Their beauty, their charm, was lost. This saddened me, and this made me cry.
Sun, look at me! Rain, shower me! Oh tall cliff, protect my roots, don't let my life be lost, don't uproot me, don't throw me away!
Daisy, delicate, beautiful one! Sun of your beauty, look at me at least once in a thousand times, grant me your smile! I am a poor, wretched grass, have pity on me! Mountain breeze, life-giving spirit of nature! Blow on me, cool my burning heart!
Eagle, proud bird! If you believe in God, try not to show my eyes when you shed the blood of innocent souls; don't let my ears hear their moans, because their moans are my moans, the sighs and lamentations of my heart. Creator, protect me, preserve the grass clinging to the barren rock!..
