It was summer. The mountain was green. Snow was visible only on the high peaks, and avalanches in the lower valleys. Shepherds had taken their sheep and cows to the mountains for the summer, but they faced misfortune: a plague broke out, countless sheep and cows were falling ill and dying; they couldn't keep up with skinning them; many streams were tinged with streaks of blood. Carcasses were scattered abundantly in the valleys, on the avalanches, around the sheepfolds and barns. A desirable time had come for birds and predators: enormous vultures, kites, eagles, and crows were feasting; satiated and bloated with carrion, they would sit on nearby rocks, their feet and wings carrying blood, staining the rocks, ledges, and crevices.
A well-fed vulture sat on top of a cliff. He was barely breathing from fullness, but his eyes darted around boldly, greedily fixating on the pile of carcasses in the abyss. "Ha, ha, ha!" he laughed at last, "Look, just look at that fool, that wretch, that worm, that miserable creature! I wish he could get at least one bite, and then speak ill of me, then I'd curse him. God forbid, let's weigh ourselves on a scale, brother, I'd outweigh two thousand nightingales. If I soar into the air, spread my wings, a human eye could see me from a thousand miles away, but that weakling, if he doesn't bump his head, can't even be seen; no one has seen him fly, apparently he crawls in the bushes, the thorns, and whispers something, and for that, they praise him. He whispers, half-asleep, with his eyes closed. He's not even the size of my eyes, which never close and are always ready for food and prey. And he keeps whispering and whispering, not even thinking about food or drink, and even calls my curses and croaks 'music'...
"Caw, caw!" a sound was heard. A black crow was approaching the vulture. First, he playfully circled the complacently seated vulture, even brushing his wing against his, wanting to knock him over, but seeing that the vulture, weighed down by satiety, couldn't move, he landed and perched on the rock next to him.
"Crow, crow!" the vulture turned to the crow and began to question him in a haughty tone: "Well? What were you saying about the nightingale the other day, that it sang beautifully? I wish I were a nightingale too?! You fool, you idiot!"
"Yes, I'll tell you the same thing I told you before: I won't forget its song in my lifetime, and you won't believe it, but hearing its song is even better than that pile of carcasses."
"Well, how was it, how? Tell me!" the vulture asked again.
"It sang wonderfully, wonderfully! No matter how many times I've gorged myself on carrion, the flesh of various animals or birds, I've never experienced such a moment of pleasure in my life; but when I listened to the nightingale's song, my heart started pounding, I could hear its tremors, its sounds clearly. It didn't stop all night, didn't rest. It was just the meadow and it."
"What were you doing in the meadow at night?" the vulture said angrily.
"I was waiting for carcasses to appear in the mountains, I was wandering around the lowlands looking for food. By God, I found plenty. I got lazy to go up to the mountains, and one night I stayed in the meadow on a huge branch. That night I heard what I've never heard in my life, and maybe I'll be worthy to hear the nightingale's voice again. I might even go there tonight, I'm not hungry or anything. I'll go, sit on the same branch, and listen, and in the morning I'll come back here. A raven was sitting on the same tree, on another branch. Although he spoke reluctantly, he translated every word for me; I only liked the sound, I didn't understand the words. The raven knew the nightingale's language well and translated it in detail. You know, he stays in the lowlands all year round and learned it easily."
"What did he translate, why don't you tell me too?" the vulture asked again.
"Many things, who can count them all! I couldn't learn them all," the crow told him. "But I remember a few things. This is what the nightingale sings: 'Come out, flowers, beautiful, delicate, angels of the earth, I will bow down to you, I will sacrifice myself for you. Without you, may God not give me even one day of life, you, you are my life. Forest, crown of the earth, always rejoice with leaves and fruit, always be green, always be lush, and I, your poor singer, will sing to you, praising your beauty, your creator. May your innocence never be tainted by any sin, so that I don't cry bitterly, so that my heart doesn't break!
'Springs, pure, crystal-clear rivers! Nature pours you out like milk, so that all animals can quench their thirst, so that you can water, gladden, nourish, and raise their heads, the plants ready to wither and dry. Don't forget, my dear ones, the last worm, the last insect, because they also crave life. Don't dry up either: flow, sparkle. When I see you, a holy feeling and great love, like you, sparkles in my heart. Lord, God, bless the springs, bless the flowers, bless the forest, I bow to your grace and glory!
'Sun, comforter of all beings, warm and gladden everyone with your gracious rays, but don't burn, don't scorch, don't destroy the creation of man and nature; you, heavenly breeze, help the sun, mix together and sow grace on earth! Forces of nature, gather around me, listen to my plea: here are the villages, here are the huts, there are orphans, poor, wretched people crying. Help them, make the crying laugh, feed the hungry, your power and grace!.. Oh, the poor! How many cry, how many sigh, and their tears gather in my heart like a sea, suffocating me, poisoning my life.
'How many shepherds cry, and their livestock is dragged away by vultures and crows, ugly, ungrateful, evil birds, feeding on the tears of others, rejoicing on the graves of others. The thought of them sickens and poisons me.' And so on and so forth."
"What? Vultures and crows?" the vulture said angrily: "That sun, vultures and crows are its pieces and fragments, they only croak like that and can't enjoy the pleasures of this world. What god made you not immediately jump on that speck, that wretch, that thing, and tear its head off! Wouldn't I have said so much about myself if I had been there?! Wouldn't my life be on my head if I hadn't torn it in half right then and there?"
"If it had spoken directly, in plain words, I would have done the same, but it spoke so beautifully, so gracefully, that I was stunned, my claws stuck to the tree branch, my beak went numb, it subdued me, weakened me. I'm sure if you were in my place, you wouldn't have made a sound, you wouldn't have moved a feather. Not only would I not have torn it apart, but I'm going back there tonight to hear the nightingale's song again, and if you want, you can come too. You can vent your anger there. It's easy to kill it, to catch it. It always sings with its eyes closed; I saw it myself in the morning, its eyes were closed and it was chirping."
"I'll come," said the vulture, "and I'll teach it a lesson, I'll show it what's what."
"Let's see, follow me, then let's go!" said the crow. "Caw," the crow took off, and the vulture flapped along with him, and they set off together.
Dusk had fallen when they both, the crow and the vulture, landed on the large branch in the large meadow, settled heavily, and folded their wings comfortably.
Night fell. The crow, with wide-open eyes and an outstretched neck, impatiently awaited the nightingale's chirping. The vulture, however, ungracefully lowered its hooked beak, contracted its shoulders, and lay on the branch of the tree like a white sack.
"Why isn't it singing, where the hell has that ugly, wretched creature gone?" the vulture said after a while, "Shout at it at least, so it makes a sound."
"Be patient, a little longer, be patient," the crow replied, "If I shout, what will it hear, and who knows, maybe it'll sing under duress?!."
A little time passed, and at first, they heard a sound like a moan.
"Here, here, it's starting, it's starting!" said the delighted crow, "Listen, it's him, it's him, he's singing, he's started, now it's up to you to vent your anger!"
The moan was followed by a trill, first slowly, slowly, calmly, and then the divine voice rose.
The vulture raised its head and opened its eyes. It shuddered. Midnight had arrived. The nightingale was singing, and the vulture was also saying, "Oh, oh, oh, - it really, really touches the heart, crow!.."
Dawn broke, darkness met light, the crow stared at the vulture and noticed that two tears were clinging to the grumpy one's eyes, he had been crying.
"Well, uncle, what are you going to do, kill it if you can, why are you hesitating, why are you silent?" the crow said smugly.
"I got lost in thoughts, thoughts carried me away. I don't want to fulfill my promise anymore."
"I told you, you wouldn't dare do anything. Remember?"
"I remember, and you weren't lying," the vulture said with a sigh.
It was midday when the vulture and the crow were sitting side by side in a large ravine, pecking at carrion.
