Everyone, including me, loves a high mountain decorated with greenery and flowers; The smell of spring, the newly growing grass, as if it is not suitable for the newly melted ice, has innocently, harmlessly raised its head and looks at the sun, the country, is sleeping, sleeping, but the tender, darkened face is covered with an inexpressible sadness: - I have come to life, give me grace, - as if humming. It is amazing that some of the frozen trees will turn their leaves and others will bloom with the warmth of spring. What can be compared to the obscure, dense, dark, misty forest!..
But now I forget everything and only one dry beech comes before my eyes. It also stands in a dense forest, on top of a rock. This rock was also covered with green moss like velvet. Other trees stand far away from the dry beech, as if they are separated from the Ganges and stand proudly on top. Close to a dry beech tree, a few crimson legs have come, with leaves of roe deer and deer's bite. They strain and spill down the river, licorice grows several feet in its roots, green in winter and summer, with jagged leaves, the sign of life has gone from the dry beech: only three branches are left in the middle of the year downwards, the upper body is broken and crumpled and opened in the ravine. Out of these three branches, only one of them grows three or four leaves in a year, and they are also discolored, wrinkled, and yellow. And the other trees, if you look, stand laden with the sustenance of nature's gift. They don't throw the dry beech for nothing, they don't pay attention, only in winter, when they sometimes steal their wedding clothes and, if they get a little or a lot closer to the dry beech, then if they get too hot, they will also be killed... This will happen exactly when the fair-faced, bright-faced, hairless "mother of the place" of nature He tells a tale about love, purity and life as a consolation. Then they scold the dry beech tree: "What are you angry about, poor thing? Listen to what he is saying!".
The dry beech sighs with a deep sigh, and neither ill nor well listens to this proud plant, but it listens to the tale of the "mother of the place"; Each of his words falls on my heart like a blessing and silently sheds tears.
Poor beech! There was a time when this tree stood proudly, towering over the other trees and covering the entire forest with its thick branches and leaves. A soaring eagle rested on its perch, barking proudly. And now the soul warrior has been touched, he is ready to fall. There are several places on the body where the dry bark is flaking, and the sides are visible. One Alag threw the bark further and threw it down towards the earth; Do you think they gave him a dagger and threw away the papers? This beech tree has so many worms that whenever I pass by it, I always see a woodpecker on it. This is the only thing that comes to mind, and whatever strength and effort it has, it shakes the beak that calls out, that needs to be answered; At the same time, it stings and stings, as if it gets a sign. How many places has Gulamdi's beech tree grown? Tragedy begins to grind the heart. The beech tree stands, stands undisturbed, unruffled; He doesn't say good or bad.
When the wind blows, other trees shake, only the dry beech does not move; And before, when he was healthy, full of life, he would start to stir like the sea when the wind blows; Its branches and leaves make a noise like thunder. The branches of the dry beech proudly beat the earth, as if bursting, yes, now the dry beech can no longer follow the wind like other trees, it can no longer hold its heart and chest relentlessly against the storm. A dry beech will not grow, and if it breaks, whatever we say... it will break, fall, be burned to the side, roots will appear, holding their heads up, as if they are praying, begging God for help. In summer, dry beech is more tolerable. Other trees are decorated with green leaves, harmless, carefree; A thousand birds sit singing over them, the hummingbirds hum on their branches, the cherona bird sings an endless song, the cypress whistles to them and restlessly jumps and jumps; Roe deer and deer shadow them. These leafless trees proudly look at the dry beech, they laugh at it and say: "I wish you didn't hurt us!" - they don't know that the dry beech is more famous than they are, and they find people who like and love the dry beech in trouble... three times a day in the village At least they will come up with dry beech, - where did you take your goods today? - When the father asks his children, they show him the area of ​​the dry beech tree, the top or the bottom, the head or the end.
– A tiger is nesting under a dry beech tree, in a rock, - there is a voice in the village: - Throw the cubs. The hunters saw the tracks of the mother tiger and her cubs around the dry beech tree.
– I will press this fateful mushroom on a dry beech tree, - says the other.
Indeed, foolish trees do not know that people have not yet forgotten the name of the dry beech tree, they still remember its greatness.
Is all that is dry
Is it possible to complain about a man?!
A thousand lives many times
Ten times better than one dead.
Seeing you, Tyalo,
My heart hurts, it's hot
Because I see you, that Bechavad
And the bull is without an owner,
as if to raise an alarm
It is a funeral bell.
I want to brew for a long time
And there is a boil in the heart
let me share with you
let me go
There are tears.
What did you come for, Bechavo?
Don't you mourn if he is dead?!
It didn't even happen to you.
There is nowhere to lose!
Who is shaking the coffin,
Who will light the candle?
oh how hard it is to die
Let the name be lost!
At night, once in a thousand, an owl will sit on a dry beech tree, and with the voice of a dacodile, it will follow the heartbroken cry: "Can't you find it?" And, when the exhausted one hears: "No way, no way", he will hang his head and cry "Hollow, hollow" in a low voice to his heart.
In winter, the wolf sometimes visits a dry beech tree, hangs out next to it and howls, tired of hunger. A dry beech tree stands unconcerned, it does not say good, nor good, it stands in awe; He knows neither pity nor hatred; The heart does not boil for revenge, nor for good; A dry beech thinks about itself, the past, the present and the future; It is as if sadness is deeply embedded in the heart. Sometimes one of its roots sprouts from a small sprout that tries to grow in the sun and rain. This is the consolation...
