The rock stands without feet, as a native, face-to-face, furious. It stands like that, uniformly winter and summer. This rock is a whole mountain turned into rock, turned into stone, facing the sky, the sun and the country below. At first glance, it is horribly, dissimilarly carved with unevenly and irregularly stacked boulders: blackened in some places, yellowed in some places, bruised in others, scratched, rough, and torn from the ravine. You are amazed, you are amazed by good observation and how beautiful it seems to you, like a brave man who has fought in a thousand wars, wounded and damaged by a thousand, but still bravely, bravely and relentlessly shining and fighting. It is very hostile, it is always on the alert, always snoring and carelessly glancing at one side: perhaps it is waiting for the enemy.
Two kinds of evil kill the heart of the rock: one is the sky, the other is the bar. It looks beautiful across the bar, open fields. The bar looks like a mountain lying at rest. This kills the heart of the rock: why is he not always on his feet like me, why is he not sober; Curses the bar of wealth useless. He loves Bari, it's all in his eyes, he couldn't make me greedy with his love, he wants to come and hug her, but he can't change his rules when he's a rock, he couldn't come. For once, the sweetness of love is not worth tasting. This is more painful, it will kill the heart more, but the love in the heart of the rock has strengthened a thousand times. With what heart does the wretch want to cut a single rose, or ia, on his chest. In silent love, Msvlak kills the eagles, his children, he often tells the story to Barisa, when they come back from a trip and sit on his lap...
Poor rock, poor rock! I understand, I understand your presence, your heart response. You are still a rock, you will not lose your rockiness, you will not crumble, because you are a rock...
Yes, the eagles are circling the head of their parents, telling them: on this and that day blood was spilled in the bar, on this and that day love fell...
The rock stirs night after night so that no one sees it and does not condemn it. The cry of that is greater than the cry of the sky. They still don't shed as many tears as they can, they are afraid that the bar will tear them apart. No one knows this and that's why they sometimes say: "It's a rock, it's cool, why don't you cry, what a mess." The mountain listens to the cry of the rock and closes the black fog as a helmet while thinking black. A wise man with tears in his eyes, hanging on a cliff, heartbroken, hears his mother's cry and tells him, but her voice is drowned by the cry of the rock. The eagles, who have no fear in their hearts, will hear the cry of the rock and hide their heads under their shoulders. For the first time, a rock comes to the moon, and even what looks over his head stops him: "Rad Steer, rad, my friend?!"
Tears will roll down the rock's face, wash its heart and chest, and go down with a white head. He goes and smiles:
I am a tear of a rock, nature
Cream of Varam;
A bunch of flowers on your chest
Mine is cream with white.
Bari also asks him the story while crying and tells him with tears:
It's cool, yes, in the old days,
as it caresses a rock, like a rock,
But in the end your wish
Rjulada gave a cry.
Everything else is good
With head, heart, chest, bottom.
Where will the castle be built?
Azelil lime with milk,
By the rock, it is such a native
with a mouth that appears to be crooked.
Barry will pour the rock's tears on his heart, attack him, make him bleed. If the eagles say this, the rock will rest a little. Is it only the rock that sighs and stirs: in the heart of the rock, someone else sighs, trapped in darkness. Many tears came to Varam's eyes if he cried a lot and shed tears. What is the problem with the rock, it still sees the sky and the sun, the earth, but this someone is spiritually sighing in the heart of the rock, it is deprived of everything, except suffering. Tied with a thick chain, spilled, bearded and even covered with moss... no one hears that moaning more than the rock. The sword is right there, the sword is there. When he sees them, his heart dies. He used to use one at one time and now he has become a food for rust with his weapon. Day changes to day, night to night, the sun rises and sets, but this man is not relieved; Century after century, and there was no help for him, no salvation...
Who is the savior of the hero? no one There is only one Goshi who owns it, he grinds the chain tirelessly throughout the year, and when he brings it to break, the blacksmith will hit a die on the shaft and the chain will be sharpened again. Hopeful Amiran sighs, the rock shakes and tells him: "Don't give up, don't lose hope. You can see how many firestorms pass over my head and I still stand strong."
Night after night, the cicadas throw themselves at the foot of this rock and sing:
Angels hurt, we love
When we see the suffering of others.
suffer you are suffering
What are you doing in the apartment?!
raise a sea of ​​blood
When you were dead, you stood on the grave.
The sword was cutting you in one go
They lay the body and the iron on the body.
Now go to Darejan
and his sister Tina.
Don't moan, Amiran,
Plead with Fina:
loco and chain gnawing,
The hand to reach the sword...
Seeking good for the country
worn out glory is yours.
sigh a thousand times more
You've been a little bit
I drank it bitterly
It's the day of your life.
When the warblers finish this song, a bird the size of a woodpecker will fly out of the rock, and it will make a light and call the warblers:
God bless you high
by the power of the trinity of three,
that Amiran's suffering
You will not be warmed by guilt.
You will see Amiran again
with a sword in his hand, with an eight on his body,
They will follow you
with the arm of his mighty one.
