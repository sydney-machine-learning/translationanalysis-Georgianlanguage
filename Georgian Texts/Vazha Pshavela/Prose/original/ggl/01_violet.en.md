I have come to the dense forest... As long as I am alive, I will sweeten the forest, the grass, and the mossy rock with my beauty, I will sprinkle spices on the surroundings. Everyone loves me: if that rotten bastard keeps his eyes on me, he laughs at me, he wants to come to me, - kiss me, but he can't, he only laughs at me from afar, he smiles pitifully, although ugly, but the kindness is sometimes reflected on his face.
Is that the only reason they enjoy my life? Even the topless trees are leaning on me from above, they themselves are bare, their branches cover me: let not our yew get cold, or let nothing freeze. They don't let direct rain fall on me: the rain can wash off the leaves at once. Being leafless and dying are the same thing for me. No, the trees: birch, beech, hazel, tamel, dudgula surround me and make me strong, they keep the rain dew with their branches and leaves and then they slowly sprinkle my mouth with one or two drops of dew, they wash my mouth. I will sing my throat and miss, I wish I could sing, I wish the creator gave me the talent to have above me the sky and the clouds, the sun, these trees of my protection, these mountains, those marshes and the birds that dry, yellow in the leaves with red and green feathers before me They play with me and sometimes lick my mouth, they play with me, they enjoy my life. My life of one month is better than another's life of twenty-four months, but I miss a long life. In the morning, a "beech-cheetah" chirped near me, it was a beautiful thing, red-throated, gabua; Like me, he liked himself, looked at his heart and shoulders; Everyone likes themselves, everyone enjoys life, everyone loves nature.
The sky was thundering yesterday. The thunder does not frighten us: the thunder brings rain, and the rain suckles us at the heart of the earth. The sun is our father, he always looks at us and cares for us, he watches over us. They are happy about the arrival of rain with plants, - they are happy, they gathered in the joy of Kelamdi; Now they will wear new dresses and khatibs. It's been two days since my daughter Sasutela appeared; Rejoicing, rejoicing, the poor man keeps shaking his head up and down, playing with the earth, the sunlight, whispering to me, telling me tales about life and love; Sometimes he even giggles, hugs me and kisses me. Yesterday morning my Dobil and I both cried.
How unforgiving is a man?! Whatever he sees, he wants to use it for his own benefit. Maybe he can't appreciate our beauty! A man walked in front of us with an ax on one shoulder and a rifle on the other. He approached one of the beautiful branched beech trees, threatened with an ax and felled it. Sabralo groaned when he fell. A cuckoo rose up from us and did not leave a dry, fallen leaf. When the tree fell, Zevida threw leaves and blushed red, tears welling up in her heart.
In the afternoon, a tired and exhausted kedan came and sat in front of us on the elm branch and started humming. He was also happy about the coming of spring and seeing a familiar place again. Suddenly, the gun went out, Kedan lost his voice, first he hung on a branch by his foot, then he fell to the ground, he fell in front of me. His nose began to bleed and he closed his eyes; The spilled blood fell drop by drop on the leaves. Sasutela and I got shivers... I can't hear anything clearly, only some bubbling, gurgling, muffled noise coming from my chest.
Wow, what a shame
Yes, come to the mountain!
Bechav will feel the cold,
or he will tie a zipper on his head;
God gave it as water
life is short
The beauty of the country is from him
It's one hundred seconds.
Ia will start kissing
He will say: "Wahmeo!
If you gave birth to me, Lord,
Why not have a great day, father?!
