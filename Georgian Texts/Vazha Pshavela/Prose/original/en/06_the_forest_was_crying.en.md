A great hullaballoo could be heard in the meadow, which was surrounded by thick,
dense forest. Women, men, children and dogs were all mingling together like flies! The
greater part of the gathering were armed with rifles. The bloom of joy and happiness was
bursting out on the faces of them all; all their lips were sparkling with smiles; the folk
were looking over the buck-deer, which lay sprawled out, having been killed by the
hunters that morning. In silence lay the scion of the forest, nurtured in liberty in the lap of
the forest; his eyes, now dead eyes, were swimming in foul liquid; his tongue was lolling
out.
When the hunters’ horses saw the dead deer, they moved away, snorting violently, and
turned their backs on it — they didn’t want to look upon the sight. And so, they started
grazing at a distance at the bottom of the field, tight on their tethers. The children
couldn’t yet bring themselves to go right up to the deer and were only now stretching out
their arms to the branches of its antlers.
“Hurry up and skin it!” the women were whimsically shouting. “Let’s see what a deer-
kebab tastes like!”
Someone yelled out: “Come on, you women, before the kebab’s done, let’s breathe in
the air, let’s get the blood flowing, then we’ll eat all the better. Well, then, before the
kebab’s done, bring on the tambourines, the drums and the bongos!”
“That’ll be very good — better than good,” cawed out a chap with a huge moustache
and was the first himself to begin kicking and capering like a bull returned from the
summer-pastures. He generously first took up the invitation offered by the sound of the
tambourines and bongos. Others followed his lead and began prancing about on the
green, in full enjoyment of life’s sweetness. Some had no time — they were skinning the
deer. The killing of the deer was having the effect of increasing tenfold this gaiety;
everyone’s longing was fulfilled — they had killed a deer; wasn’t this the idea behind so
large a gathering coming out into the country, that they should kill a deer or roe? — and
they had done precisely that. Their heart’s desire was satisfied; today, all present there
were happy. Only the forest, all-encompassing Nature was not sharing in the happiness;
the forest was weeping — yes, the great slope, the hem of the mountain, which looked
down upon the meadow where they were skinning the deer, was crying. The ridges,
hidden by the black forest, were wafting their sighs and moans about, snatched this way
by the breeze, over the meadow where the buck-deer was laid out.
The grey-haired trees — limes, oaks, elms, maples, poplars, beeches, birches, ashes
and many others were sighing in grief; all as one had learnt, although they stood at a fair
distance from one another, of the death of their beloved child. The forest is the deer’s
mother; the forest used to cover it like a blanket. The forest used to watch and gaze
lovingly upon the buck-deer and felt pleased with itself for having raised such a stately,
beautiful child.
The beauty of the very forest itself was interwoven with the beauty of the deer. The
loveliness of the deer affirms the beauty of the forest. Do you suppose that the untidy and
the ugly can ever bring forth beauty? In the deer the forest could see itself. The deer is the
forest’s good deed. Well, go on and say now whether the forest has ever been stingey
with anything at all that fell within the deer’s compass of desires?! The deer held sway
over the intractable forest, as though it were his complete possession; this only gave the
forest delight and no displeasusre at all; it wished the child that it had itself nurtured to
stand out as a fine, stately, intelligent, strong and famous warrior.
The deer’s good fortune was the good fortune of the forest itself, just as a child’s good
fortune is the eternal glory of its parents.
“Alas, pride of my eye! Woe is me! A light would shine in my heart whenever he
would pass in front and roll at me his lovely, undeceitful eyes,” said in the forest a rock,
overgrown with green and yellow moss, and branded and entangled with the roots of oaks
and beeches.
Who would have allowed the deers, the slaughtered one’s comrades, to come
unmolested to pay their tearful farewell? In alarm they were racing away — they had
their own lives to think of. In the forest just a blackbird’s stirring is deemed to portend
potential death. They roll their eyes hither and thither, they prick up their ears, sharpening
their hearing. They sniff the breeze; the smell of man fightens them more than that of the
wolf.
The forest was crying…
In the shade of a massive oak a long table was spread — the serried ranks of men and
women had themselves adorned the edges of the table. There was much drinking and
eating, tremendous feasting — the clinking of glasses, the sound of singing and merry-
making was everwhere to be heard. Hot upon the heels of singing came the games and
the bellowing of laughter.
The sun was extinghished over towards the west; evening was drawing on; the hunters
prepared to depart for home; the women settled themselves in the cart; the youths began
to vie with one another on horseback. They hung their rifles about themselves as
elegantly as possible; without words all their actions gave expression to the following
message: “We are slayers of game, jolly handy rifle-shooters, and therefore good chaps to
boot!...”
The hunters returned home satisfied, joyful. The field was abandoned like an orphan;
upon it could be seen merely what was left of the fire where an hour before the flames
were crackling and over them was roasting the kebab of deer, strung up on wooden spits,
there where the long table had been spread and the bellowing of the laughter of women
and youths and their merry-making had been echoing. Here and there lay the thoroughly
gnawed bones of the deer, chewed by dogs after men’s teeth had had their fill.
But the forest was crying and muttering: “Alas, my renowned child, ‘Old Antlers’,
when, oh when, shall I rear another child like you, so beautiful in antlers and body?! I
was so proud of you, and after today who on earth can fill me with such pride?!”
The forest continued lamenting and shedding tears as well…
