Standing and expectant! Boundless is the mountains’ sense of expectancy; like a
limitless sea it lies upon their heart, clotted red, the colour of blood, quivering in their
bosom. But yet, from without, their countenance reveals nothing — nothing but an empty
stare. And this is indeed a sign of expectancy. Who knows what mysteries reside in the
heart of mountains, what fire boils within and spills out?
O mountains, mountains! What is it, who is it that you await? Can it be that you have a
beloved, for a long while unseen? Have you lost a son perhaps? Perhaps you have a
brother or a mother who has journeyed far and of whom no news has reached you?
Answer comes there none! They stand with brow unruffled. Expectant in the past,
expectant now, and again in the future expectancy will be their lot. What will dry up that
sea of expectation in their heart? It has no end, no fulfilment, like a deity…
When every living creature, every insect, the grass, flowers, river and the restless,
unwearying breeze fall asleep, then and only then will they breathe a heavy sigh and shed
a tear. We, mankind, in such circumstances, are wont to say: “Ah, what sorrow lies upon
my heart like a heavy boulder!”
Mountains, why do you not sing?! Must I really die without being able to hear your
voice, your singing?! Why don’t you laugh? Shew me your smile at least, my dear ones!
How could a single thought have so enslaved, ensnared and beat you to its will that every
other force and sign of life have been trampled down within your heart and mind?! No,
no — from time to time you too rejoice — and to think that the world supposes you feel
nothing! I do know, don’t I, that torches are lit in your heart whenever a proud eagle in
freedom wheels around your summit and descends to rest upon your lap? How lovely you
are then! How fitting for you it is that that child you have reared is so bold, unbending
and beautiful! I am right, am I not, in thinking that he is also your messenger who reports
to God and brings Him your news…?
Have you no opinion, no feeling? Do you not dream? Of course you do! What else are
those beautiful flowers that adorn your breast? They are your dreams, hopes, consolation!
Why do you shroud your head in thick mists if you are not silently contemplating
something and are not concealing that thought from us, the sons of men?! Why do you
produce the grass? Why do you pour forth the cold springs? Why do you send rock-falls
crashing down? Why do you nurture buck-ibexes? Whom are you seeking to deceive, you
noble ones?!
They stand expectant. The rain pours down on their head; the lightning singes their
golden crest; the thunder-bolt plays around their eyes and frequently even embeds itself
like an arrow in their breast. All this is a mere nothing. Often half a mountain crumbles
and slides down into the ravine in a fall of rock. This is nothing — if only a crag and the
boulders remain thus expectant. Go, whoever among you does not wish to be with me
here, high up, close to the sky, and live out your life in the valley below!
It’s snowing. It’s freezing. It’s cold. The stones are cracking. The mountains have
donned, as it were, a shroud, as though they were dead. They call upon us to bury them,
to bewail them. Yet we rather expect to receive burial from them…
They stand expectant. Their heart aches; it aches a lot. But they do not perish; they do
not pine away. They are waiting — but for whom, for what? For something, surely, for
something. And this something must be the sight of something not yet witnessed. They
have seen and exhausted everything within the reach and compass of their eyes and heart.
It is for something other, something new that their eyes and heart now thirst. This is
surely the insatiability of their eyes and heart, isn’t it? Yes, it’s precisely that.
