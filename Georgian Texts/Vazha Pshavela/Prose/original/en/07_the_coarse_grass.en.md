I am the mountain-grass, sprung to life in the centre on the side of a huge, bare rock.
No other plant can prosper here apart from me. For me alone has Destiny written:
“Coarse mountain-grass, let the rock be your father and mother, your fate and fortune,
your past and future!”
“O rock, is it really true that you are my father and mother, my guard and protector?”
“It is true, have no fear, my poor one.”
On all sides I am girt with boulders tightly jammed. Who knows how deeply they have
fixed their roots? Some of them do not listen to me, as though I did not even exist; they
stare fixedly at the chasm. What are they searching for there? What have they lost down
there? They would not tell me, were I to ask them a thousand times. They are
contemplating something; limitless is their musing, unknowable their heart’s desire. From
time to time the rock breathes a sigh — probably some affliction is causing it to grieve.
Otherwise my mother is inflexible and stout-hearted; no fear has she of rock-falls, which
regularly in winter-time with thunger and lightning lay themselves down upon us — they
come and fall down with a crash into the abyss; plummeting down they sigh heavily, as
though they have taken a rest.
The rock sometimes actually weeps. I too cry then, for I see my mother’s tears. My
mother weeps for her own dead children, who ever lie before her eyes. However much
she may want to, in no way can she take her eyes off them. The rock’s children are the
boulders which lie upon one another down below, plucked from the rock’s breast,
wrenched away from her bosom…
Just look here how from below they gaze up at their parent in a way that melts the
heart, as though they are beseeching her: “Why will you not lift us up? Why are we not
up close to you?” Useless would be their begging, their supplication, even supposing they
were able to yearn for this, but of course they cannot. I too look down upon them and
shed dew upon them drop by drop. For them this is particularly pleasurable.
I wish someone would give me just one friend, to whom I could chat from time to
time. May God succour the flowers which look across at me from the slopes of the
mountain opposite. They murmur and sing sweetly in a low, gentle voice. They, forlorn
just like me, greatly love the mountain-heliotrope. O lovely heliotrope, how far above me
you are, and yet how you pierce my heart!
How adoringly I gaze upon it — both my eyes and heart hunger for it — I cannot take
my eyes off it for a second. I love it so much, but it will never once glance across at me to
regenerate this heart of mine, perishing and consumed with ardour; no, it peers at the sun
that it loves. The heliotrope is the sun’s lover. From east to west its whole face follows
the passage of the sun. When the sun sets, it sobs away, upset at this separation from its
beloved. The crying of the heliotrope sets me crying too. Yesterday, I believe, it shot a
glance at me as well. No, the heliotrope is pure and free from sin, wheras I am ugly and
sinful. Must I really always be encased in blood and down? This is all the fault of that old
eagle that nests alongside me. As soon as she awakes of a morning, she starts a horrible
barking; she is evidently threatening someone — she flashes those gigantic, blood-loving
eyes and then takes off to forage; no bird blocks her way. She brings back her catch,
perches on one of the boulders she has usurped above me, and then she tears it to pieces;
blood drops down and falls right on top of me. How can I avoid it? I am coated red with
blood; then the sun peers down at me and dries the blood all over me. No doubt it is
because of this blood that the heliotrope averts its eyes from me, otherwise it would
probably call over to me just once: “Grass! Child of the rock, good morning to you!”
I love this flower… You men call it the heliotrope because it constantly has its face
turned towards the sun — it is the sun’s lover. Just as a child’s eyes follow after its other
and try never to let her become hidden from them anywhere, just so the heliotrope’s eyes.
The sun is its mother — the heliotrope is the sun’s offspring.
Who has any idea that I love the heliotrope? And yet what is this kind of love? I
cannot go across to it; it cannot come to me; we cannot kiss each other. Love such as this
is an exquisite torture. I wait impatiently for each dawn, for then I can see my sweetheart.
When the winter sets in, my heart turns black, and the heliotrope also melts into the soil.
Would that I too might melt down in order that perhaps one part of me might meet part of
the heliotrope face to face down there. Spring comes, and the heliotrope comes back to
life; so do I. I forget about the moss and mould congealed on my neck; I think myself to
be the heliotrope and, like a madman, say: “Darling, you beautiful creature!”
Would that I knew it — where do the flowers go in winter? I believe that this is called
‘death’. Who taught me the word ‘death’? Ah yes, this boulder here, which has thrust out
its snout at my side and angrily looks down over the earth — it and that 200 year-old
eagle. No, ‘death’ cannot he anything good. Yesterday when that resless old creature up
above me swallowed down a grouse, what a commotion the poor thing made, while the
eagle unpityingly was ripping and tearing it apart with its diamond-sharp beak.
“Grass, you dunderhead, that’s what’s called ‘death’!” the boulder whispered to me. I
began to cry through pity for the grouse. If this is really ‘death’, it certainly cannot be
anything good.
Once I saw a horrible sight, which also resembled ‘death’. You see down here the
meadow which is visible in the distance — well, it happened there. Two groups of people
came into view from different directions. All were handsome, beautifully decked out.
Seated on horses in a fine, comely manner, they were moving at speed towards one
another. Because of the distance, I could not make out what they were saying. They fell
upon one another; I could not look directly at their flashing weapons — it burnt my eyes.
They were unseating one another, trampling one another and striking one another with
swords.
At length, as though a mist had shrouded them, all were concealed. When the mist
lifted, evening was drawing on. I could see that the horsemen were lying lifeless, just like
those boulders, together with their horses upon the meadow. This picture was enough to
reduce one to tears, and I actually wept. They had lost their beauty and handsomeness.
This upset me and reduced me to tears.
O sun, look down upon me! O rain, moisten me! O lofty rock, preserve my roots! Do
not allow the life to escape them! Do not uproot me! Do not cast me up!
Beautiful, darling, heliotrope! By the radiance of your beauty, just once in a thousand
whiles glance nevertheless over at me! Deem me worthy of your smile! I am just poor,
miserable mountain-grass, take pity on me! O mountain-breeze, Nature’s life-giving
spirit! Breathe upon me and cool my burning heart!
O eagle, you magisterial bird! By your faith in God, try not to let my eyes see it when
unpityingly you spill the blood of living creatures; let my ears not hear their moans, for
their moaning is my moaning, the sighing and suffering of my heart too! And you who
gave me birth, protect and preserve me, coarse grass that I am, suspended on a barren
rock!...
