It was summer. The mountains were beginning to turn green. Only high up on the
peaks could snow be seen; down below in the ravines there were piles of rock, fallen in
rock-falls. The shepherds had driven their sheep and cattle up to the mountains for
pasturing over the summer but were bitterly reproaching Fate — pestilence had broken
out, and countless sheep and cattle were succumbing and perishing. They were no longer
able to keep up with the skinning; rivulets of blood had merged with many a stream. In
the gorges lay carcasses sadly scattered upon the piles of fallen rubble all around the
shelters and sheep-folds. But for the birds and game-animals a blessed time had been
ushered in. The monstrous vultures, red kites, bearded vultures, crows and ravens were
having a field-day; full to bursting and bloated on carrion they were sitting landing there
on the rocks close by; with every movement of their feet and wings they were spreading
blood around and flecking with red the rock-rhododendron, coarse-grass and viburnum.

One vulture with a full stomach was perched on top of a rock. Through over-eating it
was breathing only with difficulty, but it was rolling its eyes more boldly and had fixed
its greedy gaze on a pile of carrion down in the chasm. “Ha, ha, ha!” it said with a laugh
at length, “just look, just look at that idiotic non-entity, that maggot, that miserable
wretch! Would that she were to provide me with one good meal, and then we’d see how
she’d malign and censure me! Place us on the scales, brother, and God shame me if I
don’t outweigh two thousand nightingales. When I soar up into the air and spread out my
wings by my side, a man’s eye can spot me from a thousand versts away, whilst, as for
that bit of fluff, unless you stumble upon her, you simply can’t see her at all. No-one has
ever seen her on the wing — apparently she creeps in bushes and thickets, gibbers away,
and for this they heap praises on her. It seems she sleeps, has her eyes shut, while
gibbering. Neither are they any match for my eyes, which never shut on me — I have
them ever on the look-out for food and carrion. She just gibbers and gibbers away, has no
thought of food and drink and at the same time fills the surrounds with curses aimed at
me…”
Suddenly a ‘caw, caw, caw’ rang out — a black raven was making its way toward the
vulture. First it sported with the vulture, which was perched haughtily there, and smashed
it on the wing, wishing thereby to force it up, but as the vulture, which was weighed
down by over-eating, could not move from the spot, the raven landed close by at its side
and seated itself on the rock.
“Raven, raven!” said the vulture, turning to the raven, and began to ask in an
overweening tone, “how did you put it, what were you telling me that day about the
nightingale? — that she sang beautifully?...that you wished you too could be transformed
into a nightingale? You brainless moron!”
“Yes, I say to you again precisely what I have told you already — I shall never forget
her singing as long as I live, and, you had better believe it, I infinitely prefer hearing her
sing to that pile of carrion over there!”
“Well, what was it like, what? Tell me now!” the vulture enquired again.
“She sang quite splendidly, splendidly! How often have I gorged myself on a carcass,
be it the meat of different animals or birds, and yet never in my life have I experienced
such a moment of sheer delight. But then, when I began to listen to the nightingale’s
singing, my heart started to pound so that even I myself could clearly hear the sound of
its throbbing; it did not subside or rest the whole night. Apart from this, there was nothing
in the entire clearing by the river.”
“What were you doing in the clearing at night?” said the vulture in annoyance.
“Before carrion appeared on the mountain, I used to go into the valley to forage. And,
as God is my witness, I used to find many a good picking. I couldn’t be bothered coming
back up to the mountains and spent one night on top of a huge maple in a clearing by the
river. That night I heard something I had never heard in my life before, and perhaps some
day I’ll be judged worthy of hearing the voice of the nightingale once more. This very
night perhaps I’ll go — I’m no longer hungry or anything. I’ll just go, perch upon that
same maple and listen — in the morning I’ll be back with you here. On the second branch
of that maple was sitting a crow. Although he was out of sorts, he nevertheless translated
every word for me. I was attracted just to the voice and didn’t even hear the words. The
crow had apparently come to understand the nightingale’s language well and translated it
in great detail. Don’t you know that the crow hangs about the valley throughout the
whole year and will easily have learnt the language!”
“What did it translate for you? Why won’t you tell me too?” the vulture asked again.
“Many things; who will count them?! I couldn’t memorise it all,” replied the raven.
“But I do recall a little. This, it seems, is what the nightingale sings: ‘Burst through you
lovely, beautiful flowers, you angels of the earth; I have sacrificed myself to you, my
darlings. Without you may God grant me not a single day’s existence — you, you are my
life. O forest, crown of the earth, may you forever rejoice in your leaves and fruit, stay
ever green, be ever merry, and may I, your humle songstress, go on serenading you,
praising and glorifying your beauty and creativity. May your purity be not stained by any
sin, so that there may be no reason for you to make me shed bitter tears and consume my
heart in flames!
“‘Mountain-springs, ever flowing in glistening purity! Nature makes you flow as milk
that you may quench the thirst of all creatures, that you may water the plants when they
are on the point of drying up and withering, that you may cause them to rejoice, refresh
them and make them hold their heads up high. Do not forget, I beg you, each and every
grub, each and every worm, for they too thirst for life. And do not run dry — flow and
ripple on! When I behold you, there ripples in my heart, just like you, a purity of feeling
and boundless love. Lord God, bless the mountain-springs, bless the flowers, worship my
forest, I beseech you by your grace and glory!
“‘O sun, the consolation of all living things, give warmth and heat to all with your
benevolent rays, but do not burn, do not scorch, do not ruin the good deeds of man’s and
Nature’s right hand. You, heavenly breeze, aid the sun, blend together and sow grace
upon the earth! Forces of Nature, gather around me, hear my supplication: here the
villages, here the shacks, there the orphans are crying, unfortunate and unhappy. Give
succour — bring laughter where there are tears, bring fullness where there is hunger, I
beseech you by your power and charity… Woe to the wretched! How many are crying!
How many are sighing! And their tears well up in my heart, stifle my spirit and poison
my being.
“‘How many shepherds are crying! Vultures and ravens drag away their livelihood,
ugly, merciless, evil birds which find nourishment in another’s tears and find cause to
shriek for joy at another’s grave. It terrifies me, it poisons my soul to think of them.’ And
so on and so on.”
“What was that about vultures and ravens?” asked the vulture irately. “By the sun
which she adjures, the vulture and raven are just as good as she is; like her they merely
gibber away and cannot delight in the pleasures of this world! What spirit addled your
brains that you didn’t jump upon her that very instant and batter the head off that
miserable one, that wretched one, that…? Do you think that I would have let her get away
with so much talk about me, had I been there?! Would my body not instantly be shewn to
be unworthy of life, were I not straightway to tear her in two?”
“Had she directly spoken as she did in a formally dry speech, I too would simply have
done just that to her, but she spoke in such a lovely and comely way that I lost control of
my body — my talons stuck to the branch of the tree, my beak became numb — she
enslaved and drained me of my strength. I am convinced that, had you been in my place,
you wouldn’t have been able to find your voice, you wouldn’t have been able to raise
even a chirp. Far from tearing her to pieces, this very evening I must go there and hear
again the nightingale’s singing, and, if you wish, you come along too. Get your own back
on her. It’s easy to kill her or to catch; she always sings with her eyes shut; with my own
eyes I saw her in the morning — her eyes were closed, and thus was she pursuing her
lament.”
“I’ll come along,” said the vulture, “and it’ll be a black day for her — you’ll see, I’ll
shew you what I’ll do with her!”
“Well, just let’s see — follow me then, let’s be off!” replied the raven. A ‘caw’ went
up as the raven flew off. The vulture too began to flap along after it, and they set off
together.

A thick twilight fell when both the raven and the vulture swooped down into the great
clearing onto the huge maple, alighted clumsily and unperturbably folded their wings.
Night well and truly began to draw on. The raven, with eyes staring and neck strained,
was impatiently waiting for the nightingale to strike up a refrain. But the vulture had
indecorously relaxed his food-pouch, shut tight his beak, spread out his wings and placed
them like a white sack upon the maple-branch.
“Why doesn’t she sing? Where the hell has she gone, that damned ugly creature?” said
the vulture at last. “Shout to her to find her voice.”
“Patience, be patient a little while,” replied the raven. “If I were to cry out, what
message shall I impart? What’s more, who knows if she’ll sing to order?!”
A short while passed, and they caught a sound, at first resembling a moan.
“There! There! She’s begun, she’s begun!” exclaimed the raven joyfully. “Listen —
That’s it! Like that! She’s singing, she’s begun — Well, now it’s up to you as to how
you’ll settle the score!”
A ringing sound followed after the moan, at first slowly, slowly, calmly and finally
there arose a sound that was absolutely divine.
The vulture lifted his head and opened his eyes. He leaned into the sound. It was
midnight. the nightingale was singing, and the vulture too was proclaiming: “Oh, oh, oh,
yes indeed, indeed it does cut into one’s heart, as you say, raven!...”
Morning broke; twilight merged into light; the raven stared at the vulture and observed
that two tears had become stuck to his sleep-smeared eyes and that his mood had
mellowed.
“Well, old fellow, what do you aim to do? Kill her, if you can. Why have you
quietened down and grown silent?” queried the raven, self-satisfied.
“I was thinking — my thoughts quite carried me away. I’ve changed my mind.”
“I told you, didn’t I, that you wouldn’t be able to dare to move against her? Do you
remember?”
“I remember, and you spoke the absolute truth,” said the vulture with a sigh.
It must have been midday when the vulture and the raven found themselves perched in
the great ravine side-by-side, shredding a piece of carrion.
