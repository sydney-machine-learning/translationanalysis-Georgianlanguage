This event took place in a large, thick, black forest, far removed from human towns
and villages. “What event?” you may ask. So I am going to tell you about the jays’
wedding-feast.
Jay Zakara was marrying the beautiful and excessively impish Jay Ketevan, famed for
her charm. These two young birds were being married by the venerable Jay Toma.
Toma dutifully lifted his eyes towards heaven and exclaimed: “Bless, O Lord, this
couple’s crown; instill in them love and devotion towards each other; make them fruitful
to be as numerous as the fish in water or as the stars in the sky; let the bed of your servant
Zakara and your maid Ketevan be free from stain. Amen!” Saying this, he placed a crown
of beautiful flowers on both their heads. “Amen! Amen!” echoed like thunder all around,
as the cry went up from the birds invited to attend as guests: jays, yellow-hammers,
warblers, finches, partridges, guinea-fowl, wrens, redstarts, chiff-chaffs, wood-peckers,
turtle-doves, pigeons and many others besides. There wasn’t a space left anywhere, so
many were the guests who had gathered at that spot. The flowers too were rejoicing, for
they also were invited to the wedding-feast. There was a stream running there of cold,
refreshing water. A long spread had been laid out, and upon it were arranged a thousand
different types of food and fruit. You couldn’t name a variety of worm or fly which they
hadn’t provided here — as for grass-seeds, there were a thousand types.
The bride and groom they invited onto a flower-strewn couch, and the guests then
seated themselves in rows. A great bout of drinking and feasting commenced. A thousand
different beverages were under consumption — the ruby-coloured wine of K’akheti
flowed on the table like water… Everyone toasted the bride and groom, and everyone
bestowed presents upon them.
A wood-pecker, sitting close by in a hollow stump, gave forth with the song ‘Long life
to you both!’ [mravalžamieri in Georgian].
“Hey, you, bawler, you’re not drinking any wine, old chap; what’s it all about? Drink
your wine, drink!” cried the birds in unison at the wood-pecker.
“Wait a moment, gentlemen, give me a minute or two — bless you! — I’ve just
uncovered a nice, fate worm over here; I want to dig it out — then you can pour me as
much wine as you wish; my mind will be on nothing else, and I’ll give it all my
attention.” Having thus answered them, the wood-pecker began grubbing away with his
beak at the hollow tree. Everyone turned their gaze towards him.
“Well, we’ll see if you know what you’re doing and if your manliness is equal to the
task!” shouted the birds at the wood-pecker. “But should you fail to draw it out, woe
betide your fine feathers, for you should know that we’ll be feeding you no more pickings
from this table!”
The wood-pecker spent a good while scratting about on the hollow tree with his beak
and feet — and not in vain, for he dragged out a worm of goodly length, which resembled
the cast-off skin of a snake, and with his beak offered it to the bride and groom.
“Good health to the bride and groom!” cried the wood-pecker in a loud voice. “Good
health to the whole assembled company too, hurrah!”
“Good health, good health! Hurrah! Bravo, wood-pecker! Bravo for disgracing neither
yourself nor us!” was the cry that went up from the birds. The toast-master handed to the
wood-pecker an ibex-horn filled with wine as his ‘trophy’ for such a display of manly
prowess, and he, having drained it in one go, tossed the empty horn back to the toast-
master, to play which role they had selected the same master-of-ceremonies, Jay Toma.
“They are eating bread, they are drinking wine, but it doesn’t look as though they’re
going to sing,” exclaimed a raven, and, in his own fine voice, he intoned a drinking-song.
From the different sides the raven’s tune was taken up, and the singing grew in strength
to such a pitch that the forest was set creaking in response; mountain and valley were a-
tremble. The flowers were dying with laughter.
Close by here a little mouse had his hole. The racket had aroused his appetite, and he
peeped out. For a long while he gazed at the birds’ festivities and feasting; he could see
fat, rich foodstuffs of different colours and kinds, all of which just made his mouth water,
gulp after gulp. for a long time his patience held, but at last it was too much for him.
“What will be will be,” he declared, and, with that, he scuttled closer, took a leap and
hopped down onto the nut-laden spread right in front of the bride and groom.
“Good health to the newcomer! Good health to Squeaky!” rang out the general cry of
the birds. “Hey, there’s a good little fellow for giving us your attention, laddy!” were the
words of welcome given to the mouse by the intoxicated birds.
“Good health, good health, dear friends, long life, joy and endless festivities be your
lot, and may the good Lord Creator never spoil your noble doings!” So saying, the mouse
had taken a firm grip on a nut with a decent kernel and was slowly gnawing away at it.
“Give the little mouse some wine, wine!|” shouted the toast-master. “He has a lot of
drinking to do to catch us up!”
“I don’t drink wine, my dear friends, though I’d happily give my right arm any time
for a nut; you pass the time as you please — just let me nibble away at this nut, and I’ll
be fine.”
“Did he say he doesn’t drink? What sort of reponse is that?! Ha, drink, or we’ll pour
the wine over your head!” said the toast-master to the mouse in a hostile tone of voice,
handing the horn to the wood-pecker. The wood-pecker took the horn from Toma and sat
down close by the little mouse. “Come on, little brother, drink it down. This is a
wedding-feast, you know, not some game or other! You can hardly call it fitting just to
gnaw on a nut! Look, if you want to nibble a nut, first come on, I say, and take the horn
from me!” So saying, the wood-pecker handed him the horn.
“I simply can’t drink it. If you call yourself a brother of mine, let me be. I just can’t
do it; what am I to do? — I might as well drown myself, but where’s the water?” Thus
did the mouse answer him, turning his face away.
“Pour the wine, pour it over the head of that son of an ass, that…!” yelled the toast-
master. “Don’t you really think you should toast the bride and groom, you fool, you?!”
“I’ve never drunk wine in my life, gentlemen; do you think you have the right to force
the habit on me at this stage in my life? How can this be possible? Why do you pester me
so insistently? You are honourable, goodly folk. Look, by way of toasting the bride and
groom I’m helping myself to an acorn.”
“Make him drink, make that brigand drink, that…! He has to be forced to drink; we
can’t have this. Why on earth did he drag himself in here, if he doesn’t drink wine? Make
him drink, make him drink!” resounded the chorus of the birds.
The wood-pecker seized the little mouse’s neck with one hand, whilst with the other
he brought the horn, full of wine, into contact with the mouse’s lips and began forcibly to
make him drink. “If the decision were yours, I know, you won’t drink, sir, but here it’s
the toast-master’s will that prevails. You can see that amongst all the assembled gathering
there isn’t a single individual here who is not drinking wine — you alone here have
appeared as the obstinate one. Come on, man up to the task, brave yourself to it; is it not
just as shameful to turn your face away from wine as it would be from your mother’s
milk, you mongrel, you?!”
The mouse — with what tremendous torment — managed to swallow a few drops,
whimpering the while — wine, it seemed, gave him no pleasure.
“Steel yourself to it, little mouse, steel yourself to it! Well, then! That’s it, like that.
Ah, brave little chap!” were the whooping encouragements screamed by the birds at the
little mouse.
The little mouse tensed himself, strained the sinews of his throat, struggled with the
wine and downed it, empying the horn. But a drop of the wine was spilled on his velvet
coat.
“Don’t pour wine on my coat, you numbskull! Surely you don’t see any resemblance
between it and that cloth-cap of yours which might explain such stupid behaviour!”
inveighed the little mouse against the wood-pecker. Then he let out a deep breath. Only
the very last mouthful was left, when he cried out: “Good health to the bride and groom!
Good health, best-man, to this groom of yours!”
“Good health, good health to them — he’s drained it, he’s drained it!” went up the
enraptured cry.
The little mouse soon succumbed to the wine, and he began to croon. His singing was
so squeaky that it grated on the ears of them all. Then he started to dance. The gathering
began to split its sides with laughter. A magpie accompanied him and together they
danced a Georgian jig. The ravens had to hold on to their stomachs; to such an extent
were the onlookers of this spectacle rollicking with laughter.
“Oh, I’m whacked,” said the mouse at last; and indeed sweat was pouring over his
face and chest. He flopped down right there beside the table; his pot-belly projected
upwards, and, in that supine posture, he began to pant.
Right at the end of the table was sitting a nightingale; this songster-bird was not
participating in the festivities. She was not laughing but was observing the proceedings
with a heavy and contemplative heart.
“Beautiful nightingale, why do you not treat us to your beautiful voice?” the birds
entreated her mildly.
The nightingale declined, saying: “Do you suppose that I’m always in a mood for
singing? — I’m afraid I’m out of sorts.”
At length, the birds’ supplications and entreaties had an effect on her, and she began to
sing. The birds fell so silent that the buzzing of flies could be heard; the flowers caught
their breath and, with affectionate eyes, all had their attention fixed on their poetess. This
was the song the nightingale sang:
“Glory to thee, holder of the heavens,
Glory to thee, o force of nature —
Glory to the groom, kingly crowned,
And God grant thee, his wife, long life as well!
I shall plait a crown of love,
Chastely shall I embroider it around;
I shall not be sparing but shall weave all within it
Whatsoever I may discover within the world that is noble
And wrought by a heart sincere —
This is what, young couple, I shall place upon your head.
Love is the essence of my heart,
And if I see love in another, it lights a flame in me;
This day it is your troth that is supreme,
And for that reason it grips both our hearts and eyes.”
At this moment a stag had appeared in the neighbourhood and was listening intently to
the singing of the birds and the melody of the nightingale, which roused a feeling of
sorrow in his heart. Some memory stirred, a tear came into his eyes; he sighed and
returned to the cover of the dense forest.
The birds took up the general refrain. One song it was that they all sang, but each in
his distinctive voice. In this song the praise of nature, the beneficence of the forest and of
Mother Earth were being portrayed. The birds were offering thanks for this beneficence,
when an eagle passed overheard, casting an eye all around. “An eagle, an eagle!” went up
the cry: “The king is coming!” Suddenly all lost their tongues, as no longer did they dare
to utter a sound; a quiver and shudder ran through them all.
And in truth the eagle was a dread sight at this moment — what did he want? He
wouldn’t have needed more than a single swoop to turn the crowd of birds entirely to
dust!
“Why do you flinch so, my brothers? Say something! Do you really suppose that the
king will take it upon himself to annihilate us? — is that what you imagine he desires?”
enquired the chief jay of the throng. “If you grant me the right to speak, I’ll invite the
king to join us this very minute.”
Some refused, saying: “Who can stand the glare of his eyes? We for our part will
derive no further pleasure here, as should be obvious.” Others found the idea to their
liking, saying that they should indeed invite him.
The chief jay took off straight upwards and frolicked in front of the king of birds. The
eagle, as though he had merely a fly flying before him, kept straight on.
“Greetings to Your Excellency, Your Majesty!” Thus did the jay, cap in hand, salute
the eagle.
“Greetings also to the jay,” said he in stately response.
“Your Glorious Majesty, we ask you to do us the honour of attending the wedding-
feast. We ask this of you with all our heart and soul; on bended knee we, your subjects, in
our entirety beseech this of you. If Your Majesty deigns to accept our invitation, we shall
remain ever hugely thankful to you, we your servants.”
“So let it be — why not!?” replied the eagle. “Lead the way!”
The jay dropped down headlong, and the eagle, folding his own powerful wings, also
swooped headlong down. This vignette made everyone think the heavens were being rent
asunder. The whole gathering of the birds broke up, as with much twittering and chirping
they rushed forward to meet their king. The king in his turn gave his own special greeting
to the assembly.
They invited the king and seated him at the head. All stood, cap in hand, on their feet.
The nightingale alone was not to be seen there.
“You may be seated,” announced the eagle, and the birds in their turn arranged
themselves according to rank.
It was a Monday when this event took place. All the folk who had gone into the forest,
whether to work or to hunt, remained utterly astonished; all were remarking: “What’s all
this? What can have so affected the birds that from nowhere is there any longer a single
sound to be heard?” How were folk to know that the birds were at the jays’ wedding-
feast, celebrating in glorious comfort?!
They offered the eagle wine in drinking-horns. He drank it assiduously and became
right merry. As he gave forth some heroic song with his fearsome voice, a tremor ran
through them all.
“Lord,” they all prayed to God, “Lord, in no way anger our king, otherwise he’ll
slaughter us all in an instant.”
But the eagle shewed no signs of wrath — rather he urged the birds to make merry, to
sing and dance. However, some spirit was evidently out of sorts with the birds, for their
mood had utterly altered. They did not know what had happened to them. In order to give
heart back to the birds, the eagle ordered them to blow on the bugle and strike up the
drum. The command was fulfilled that very instant, and the eagle began to waddle on his
powerful talons; he almost clawed that flowery spot to shreds. But still no-one dared to
sport, until at last the little mouse again became emboldened; he danced such a lezginka
and performed such genuflections that the dust reached right up to the sky! At one point
he became so impassioned and carried away that he jumped over the head of the eagle, of
all people! Such foolish behaviour on the part of the lad caused the king some slight
annoyance, but, for the sake of politeness and, taking into account the occasion, he said
nothing; he only flashed such a menacing glance at him that the little mouse nearly gave
up the ghost with fright. Anyway, following this menacing glance, the little mouse
became quite unmanned — he felt ill, left and lay down beneath a tree, pulling a dry
aspen-leaf over himself.
Amongst the birds, the wood-pecker was behaving the most daringly of them all. He
was quite sozzled, and his crooning was so shrill that it set the whole mountain and valley
in motion. The wood-pecker’s boldness now grew to such a pitch that he began to chivvy
even the king!
“And who, pray, gave you the crown?” he said to the eagle. “When did we choose you
as king?”
“Hey, you damned fool, shush, shut up; what are you saying — you brazen face?!”
whispered the birds to him.
“I won’t shut up, so there! Why should I shut up, why?!” the besotted wood-pecker
kept repeating. “What kind of folk are you?! You’re all subject to feelings of loathing
towards him, each in your own heart, comrades, but you daren’t actually express your
feelings to his face. Boldness consists in calling a spade a spade.”
The eagle laughed heartily at the wood-pecker’s insolence, but the birds regarded with
disdain this insult to their king; they took hold of the wood-pecker, thrust some long,
coarse grass through his beak and tied him to a tree right there. The wood-pecker grew
dispirited — he no longer dared to speak, nor did he understand the reason for such
savage punishment.
The birds were quite carried away, and, while they were in this state, a fox sneaked up,
closing in on them. For a long time the crafty creature spied upon them from the edge of
the forest, biding his time and thinking: “First let them get well and truly drunk, then it’ll
be time for me.” They noticed the fox at the very moment when he was just about to grab
the bride and groom. Shrieking and yelling broke out, as the assemblage of birds broke
up, but the eagle, with beak opened wide, crashed into the fox and in an instant frightened
it off. The birds scattered — some perched in the trees, others circled high above. On the
ground the eagle and the wood-pecker alone remained; even the poorly mouse sought out
his hole at the sound of this alarm. The eagle freed the wood-pecker and said to him: “I
forgive you all that nonsense, since you were intoxicated. But don’t you dare to try it ever
again, otherwise — woe betide you!” At this he flew off, way up high — it seemed as
though he were pinned to the heavens — and there began whirling round and round.
Ketevan and Zakara took cover in the dense forest — they passed the day in each
other’s caresses, kissing and embracing, and in the evening they fell fast asleep, perched
on the branch of a beech-tree, side by side.
