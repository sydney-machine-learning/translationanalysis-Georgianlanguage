Amiran, arise, why do you sleep?
Scatter shallots to your steed!
You who are of woman spurned,
Surely it is tears (not sleep) that by you are yearned.
Huge of body,
A man can be seen in the rock,
Gall that melts the heart
Silently boils in his breast.
An unfeeling chain around his arms
Is coiled like a snake,
And a cobweb over his eyes
Has fastened like a net.
Upon his body hang ice
And moss of black hue,
He stands upon his knees
Awaiting the one who’ll break his chains.
Set straight ahead of him
His sword grows rusty.
Rest he spurns,
Shedding his womanly tears.
This slave seems forgotten
By man below, on high by heaven;
They no longer recall his
Slaying of demons and devils.
Sharing the fate of the tormented one,
Faithful Pinia has lain down at his feet.
This tiny being
Has a strange obsession:
Unceasingly with its tongue
It licks the chain — it strives to break it,
That the tortured one may himself release
And tear asunder those foul smiths,
Who hammered on the anvil
The chain to keep him bound,
Who took no pity on this righteous man
But sent him, a prisoner, to the mountain.
As soon as Pinia to breaking-point
Brings the wire of iron,
A stony-hearted smith emerges
To start his hammer a-clanking on the anvil.
And as before the chain’s made whole,
To extinguish the heart of the slave.
This godless torment, pray,
When will it sacrifice this hero?
When Amiran arises,
Girt in his chain-mail,
Then will the ice melt away,
Then will his smile return again.
In his hand he will hold his sword,
He will gaze out over the valley,
The mountains and rocks will echo a roar,
To him their heads they will bow once more.
The earth will tremble, the clouds
Will billow up and bounce in black,
The comely, tiny stars
Will settle in ranks upon the mountains.
Wherever the sea perceives the news,
Devoutly to be desired by all who are good,
A sweet instrument it will play
And stretch its hand up to the sky.
Thence will the clouds descend,
In profusion will come both hail and lightning,
The crucifiers of the righteous will cry:
“Alas, how great his suffering!”
The smiths will repent their sins,
They will shatter their anvils and hammers,
Over the remnants of their tools
They will shed many bitter tears.
