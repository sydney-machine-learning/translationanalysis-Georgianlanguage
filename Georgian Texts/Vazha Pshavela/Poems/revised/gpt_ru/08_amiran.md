A giant figure is visible in the rock,
Silently, his heart boils with sorrow.
A lifeless chain coils around his arms like a snake,
And cobwebs entangle his eyes.
On his body, ice and black moss,
He kneels, awaiting the breaking of the chain.
Directly in front of him, his sword rusts,
He rejects peace, shedding tears like a woman.
This slave is forgotten by people on earth and in heaven,
They do not remember how he annihilated demons.
At his feet lies a small dog,
This tiny creature shows strange persistence.
It incessantly licks the chain with its tongue – wanting to break it,
To free the sufferer, to destroy the vile blacksmiths, –
Who forged the chains for his shackles,
They did not spare the righteous, sent him captive to the mountains.
As soon as the little dog almost breaks the chain,
The cruel blacksmith comes out, hammers at the anvil again.
And the chain is whole again, to enslave the slave's heart.
When will this hero be freed from unholy torments?!
When will Amir, bound in armor, rise,
When will the ice melt and a smile appear on his face.
Holding his sword in hand, he will gaze at the plains,
Mountains and rocks will shake, bowing before him.
The earth will move, black clouds will leap,
Graceful tiny stars will settle on the mountains like an army.
Somewhere the sea will hear this news, beloved by good people,
Sweet music will play, reaching out to the sky.
Clouds will gather there, a frequent fiery hail will begin,
The tormentors of the righteous will cry out: "Oh, what a great calamity!"
The blacksmiths will repent of their sins, break their anvils and hammers,
And will shed bitter tears on the remains of their tools.
