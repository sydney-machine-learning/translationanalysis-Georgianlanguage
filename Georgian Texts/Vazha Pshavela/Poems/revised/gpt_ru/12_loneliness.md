The eagle no longer visits me, does not cry out above me,
No longer do I find joy in the good, nor do I grieve the evil,
The enemy exhausts my soul, strips my skin, stands as an executioner at the door.
I do not see my eagle, to support me with its wing,
To flare up like coal, to burn in its own flame,
Or to pull the trigger, to grasp the sword.
I am no longer good for anything, completely weakened.
Come, eagle, where are you? I recognize you by your voice from afar,
When I sense your approach, I will change immediately;
I will leave the earth at once, ascend to the heavens.
Sometimes I play the panduri, sometimes I sing to the tar.
Sometimes I cry, sometimes I pray, sometimes I spew venom in anger.
When the eagle is with me, it sits on my right shoulder, –
A king’s crown upon my head, I sit on the throne!
Who would dare to insult me? All will greet me with respect.
When the eagle flies away, I am a rag, a small rag.
Hide me, do not show me, do not mistake, do not place me on the throne.
