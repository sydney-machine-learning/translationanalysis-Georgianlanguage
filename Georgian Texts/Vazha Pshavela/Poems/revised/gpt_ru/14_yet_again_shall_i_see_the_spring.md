I will still see the spring, with the violet proudly raised,
Transforming death into life, its divine magnificence,
Green mountains and valleys adorned with flowers.
I will still see the sky thunder, rain pouring instead of snow,
How the earth enriches, how the rivers roar,
No one will suffer and starve anymore;
The eagle will cry out on the mountain about the victory of justice;
I will answer him, my heart will no longer ache.
The day before yesterday I saw, and yesterday too, how a snake bites the violet,
Spreading venom and poison, but causing it no harm.
Today I see the violet intact, fragrant, tender,
I look at it and say: how beautiful, how wonderful!
The snake slithers on its belly, choking on malice and rage.
I will still see roses and violets bloom abundantly,
Those who destroyed yesterday have turned to ash and dust;
The sowers of venom and poison have disappeared, become nothingness,
The crows wishing for our death no longer caw!
Let the wind of life blow on the dying surroundings,
Let the light multiply a thousand times in the sky, on the sun and the moon,
Let mercy be generously bestowed upon this oppressed land.
We, the victims of violence, will no longer shed bitter tears,
The sweet singing of birds will be heard everywhere.
I will see the desired face, risen from the dead,
His victims standing beside him, having sworn allegiance to him,
Young men, devoted to passion above all;
Their wounds adorn the faithful sons of the homeland,
Angels place laurel wreaths on the heroes.
