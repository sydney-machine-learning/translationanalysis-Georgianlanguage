Sharpen your sword, brother, the enemy has approached the mountain:
They will devastate our country, attack us.
Sharpen, sharpen it so that it cuts even hair.
A blessing, if once again the gorge drinks enemy blood!
Here they come, the cursed ones, marching fearlessly along the road.
Any moment the gun will thunder, smoke will rise above smoke...
They will ravage our country, make the sister cry for her brother!..
Sharpen well, sharpen so that it doesn't wear out on bone.
The Lord's blessing burns on the shield of the homeland's defender...
The kiss of Queen Tamar is imprinted on the sword.
Be brave, brother, do not fear, why do you hesitate?
It is better to die once than to live a black life on earth!
And my heart calls as well, but what can I do! I am empty bones,
My hands are powerless, shackled by the earth,
My soul with God, where the heavenly forces shine.
But the memory of my country is buried here, with me.
The image of my homeland always glimmers before my eyes.
Iberia will not forget your little Kakheti.
