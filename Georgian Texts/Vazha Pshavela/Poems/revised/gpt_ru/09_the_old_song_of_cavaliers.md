Therefore, our mother raised us, singing lullabies â€“
So that we would wear armor and always sharpen our daggers,
So that we would instill fear in the hearts of intrusive neighbors,
So that we would not allow enemies to capture our homeland.
We said goodbye to our kin, wives, children, and fields;
We swore by our lives in death and stained our lips with blood.
We will not let the enemy betray our land while we live.
Will a mother ever again raise such brave men as us?!
For the homeland, we sacrifice our lives like straw,
We die with peace in our hearts and sing:
"Let the parent die, what of it, the children remain with the father,
They will still have wings in this world.
The son of a good father always frightens the enemy:
Tomorrow and the day after, no one will dare to invade us by force.
He who values his life as straw conquers all.
We will not allow anyone to betray our native land while we live.
We swore by our lives in death and stained our lips with blood.
Will a mother ever again raise such brave men as us?!"
We will not take someone else's homeland, let no one oppose us,
Otherwise, we will create a day that even the dead will laugh at.
We will not give our homeland to a foreigner while we live;
You cannot drive us away with poisonous gifts.
We will go against the enemy to perish like lions.
The enemy will not see our backs, seeing us, they will like it!
Our battles and wars will become tales for our children!
We will not give the homeland to the enemy, we will thrust a dagger into the heart,
We will not allow foreigners to betray our homeland.
So let mothers teach when they sing lullabies to their children!
Will a mother ever again raise such brave men as us?!
