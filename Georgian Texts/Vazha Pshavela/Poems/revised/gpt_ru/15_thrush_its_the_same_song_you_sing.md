Thrush, you sing the same as you did a hundred years ago!
You do not curse anyone, do not cry, do not ask for anything in return;
Whether evening falls or morning comes, you sit and sweetly sing…
You are like a child lying in a cradle, ready for sleep…
You acknowledge God as your father and yourself as His child!
Why should you complain? What could darken your mood?!
If you want, live in the valley, if you want, go to the mountain.
Your heart is not troubled, beautiful one, by various thoughts and ideas.
If you get hungry, do not worry, you will be nourished by the sun.
You will die without ever glancing at your body.
You are not bothered by the gray hairs that cover our heads.
You have never looked back on your path.
You have never said: “Why am I tired of life?!”
You sang calmly, wings beating wings.
You never thanked the tree that feeds you,
Because you consider everyone your debtors, serving you.
You have never asked: “Help me, God,”
You look at the wolf like a sheep in the field.
Your calm, childlike disposition is not darkened by an enemy;
Your sorrow is fleeting in hatred and love.
You have never worn the yoke of obligations around your neck.
You have never thought of anyone’s fate, not even your own.
Why would your heart and mind grow tired, I wonder,
When you yourself are joy, never having tasted slavery.
No one will take your homeland from you, no one will dispute your home;
Even if it happens, you will still sing and laugh,
And sleep somewhere on a tree branch,
Covered by the blanket of tranquility.
Your tearless eyes have never been washed with tears,
Your heart has not carried a wound for twenty years.
You do not wish to rise from the dead at all,
You turn death into life with your lightness.
You do not know the sufferings of people, do not know why we die…
I miss you in many ways and in many ways cannot praise you!
