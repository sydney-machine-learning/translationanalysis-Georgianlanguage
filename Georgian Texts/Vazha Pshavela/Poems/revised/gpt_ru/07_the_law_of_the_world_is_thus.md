This is the law of the village: we will leave, others will stay;
In the place of the dead, others soon appear.
Life loves life, thus it established this order;
It created death for its own amazement.
Therefore, it despises the weak, like old clothes,
Because it loves the young, the new, to adorn the year with it.
We die, bearing our love in our hearts,
We lose it personally and think it is lost to the world.
We, the dead, leave love, but it remains alive,
Flying like a butterfly, beautiful in every way,
Its heartbeat is a kingdom, the excitement of passions its parents.
It makes the hearts of the living beat again, encircling them with lilies and roses,
Because of it, the deer cries, because of it, the roe flies;
Because of it, the nightingale sings, because of it, the field turns green,
Because of it, nature flourishes â€“ down to the last insect...
A young man perishes at sea for his beloved.
Glory to the Creator of the world, how wonderfully He wrote this!
