Why was I created as a man? Why didn't I come as rain,
To always be a necklace on the chest of clouds,
To fall to the earth as dew or cold snow?
The master wouldn't have abandoned me as he left me in loneliness and bitterness!
He would have lifted me to the sky, carrying me like his child.
So I wouldn't have always had to be cautious.
I would have wandered, loving the sun, rejecting death;
The sky above, the earth below would have been my lot.
I would have rejoiced, seeing green mountains and valleys,
Watered by my sweat, with flowers inside and out.
I would have opened my chest to the day under the sun and the night under the moon.
I would have given life to the dying surroundings.
Becoming snow, I would have remained with fiery hope in my heart,
That my death would again become life
And embrace the renewed nature.
