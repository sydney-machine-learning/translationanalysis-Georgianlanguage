I want to sing and I do sing, – my heart bears three wounds:
I am troubled by thoughts of the past, there is nothing in the present,
And no one has revealed to me thoughts of the future!
A star, veiled in clouds, barely flickers,
I cannot take my eyes off it, having seen it once.
Constantly looking at it, I have become worthy of reproach.
And in my heart, a wound grows, it strangles and saddens my soul,
I do not want death, although suffering reminds me of death,
And my existence thus resembles that of poor Amir.
A sword at his side, a dog gnawing faithfully at the iron;
The sword does not reach the hero, nor does he reach it.
The gnawed chain remains intact, he sees this the next morning;
The fire of suffering and sorrow burns both the master and his dog:
The light of the future will dispel the hero’s sighs and groans.
