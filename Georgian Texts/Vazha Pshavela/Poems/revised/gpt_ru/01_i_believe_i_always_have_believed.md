I believe, I have always believed in the eternal life of the soul, a kind soul, loving its country, suffering from the fate of the country.
I believe that, when the wind scatters the ashes of a kind heart across the earth, there will still burn a fervent desire for emptiness, â€“
It will be an oppressor of evil, always a defender of good; it will support, protect, and save the poor and the needy.
Nature does not kill a kind heart, it has existed since ancient times!
