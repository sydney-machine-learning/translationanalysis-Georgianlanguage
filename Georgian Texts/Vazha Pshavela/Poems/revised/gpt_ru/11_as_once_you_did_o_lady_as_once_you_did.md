It’s you again, once more, woman, look at me, smile at me.
Do not betray me, when I die – mourn for me.
On the summit of a high mountain, dig me a grave,
Often cover me with the sand of my homeland.
Forgotten by the village, you too will soon forget me,
Soon you will find a groom, tomorrow you will go with him.
But at least cry to these rocks as per my will:
Let them stand proudly, not letting the enemy through!
Do not start to crumble… Let the eagles raise their chicks,
Let them return to my grave, often crying over it;
Let the mountains delight in flowers, wear clouds around their necks,
Let the dew fall on my dead heart, – I will live again.
