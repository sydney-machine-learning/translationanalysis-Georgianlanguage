I don't know where to go, to whom to tell about my sufferings,
Who will pity my conscience, burned in the fire?!
What have I done, Lord, that you have burdened me with this load,
And my persistent whisper follows the heart like a tax.
A man suffers, cannot endure, tries to drive me out quickly...
But without me, many have been shamed.
I will not leave the human heart, it is my eternal duty,
I will reveal to all what lies in the hearts of people.
I visited an official, a bribe-taker, a robber of the country,
He said: "Why have you come, scoundrel, I have no time for you now!..”
I replied: "Shut up, you should be ashamed of oppressing the poor,
You have left a mother of four young children without a crust of bread!”
He stood up, kicked me, hit me again and again:
"How dare you speak to me like that, poverty?!"
How many others I have told, who can count, "How you sold your mother!..”
Everyone kicked me, – how dare I speak like that?! –
I beg you, deliver me from this world, protect it, heavens!
