One day I will die and give myself to the earth, –
My heart and feelings will rest in the cold sand of the grave…
My heart will be devoured by furious worms,
The tears of my beautiful beloved will not help me,
My grieving friends will worry in vain.
The stars will descend from the sky in vain,
The river will erupt in a mournful chime, leaping from heights,
Cracks will open in the rocks, valleys will fill…
Alas, I will no longer see them, having turned into a corpse.
