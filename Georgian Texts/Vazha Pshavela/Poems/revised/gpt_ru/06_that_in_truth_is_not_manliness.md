This is not courage, when you are strengthened and become strong.
I would call you a man if you were valiant by nature.
This is also not courage, when you attack and strangle someone.
I would call you a man if you helped those in need.
Tell me, who would call it courage to support oppressors?
True courage is standing up for the oppressed.
It is not courage when you are well-fed, singing and playing,
Proud of yourself before others and causing envy.
It is not courage to silence other poets, always boasting and getting angry.
I would call you a man if you sang, even while hungry and thirsty.
