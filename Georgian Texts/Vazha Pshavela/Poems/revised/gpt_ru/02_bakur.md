– Tell us, Elizbar, what happened at Egho?  
How did the Chechens attack the courtyard of Bakur's fortress?  
– I don't want old sorrows to tear my heart apart.  
What can I say? Bakur should boast of his bravery...  
May my life end in the grave.  
– Why do you say that, man, why do you abase yourself?  
– I can only tell the truth. Should I lie for praise?  
I couldn't hold his shoulder, I couldn't die, – my soul is bitter...  
If only you had seen Bakur's war and actions with your own eyes!  
My heart is torn apart, why did I fall alive into the enemy's hands, –  
From this, now my thoughts rise as poison to my throat.  
I don't want to lift my head, and I can't straighten my back.  
– Don't worry, what can we do, they didn't let you die...  
Why are you ashamed of what is not shameful?  
We also know, we heard the tale of kilo-kavada;  
No one condemned you, thank God, no one spoke ill of you.  
Now tell us about the war in detail.  
– A large enemy army came, surrounded us with a fence,  
We fought with rifles for seven days, killed many;  
The women prepared medicines for us, – they are truly worthy of praise!..  
On the eighth day, the ammunition ran out, completely depleted  
And then we considered our efforts lost.  
Sleepless, hungry, and thirsty, – we were for the enemy then!  
Fate deceived us cruelly, we were lost, we were exiled.  
The enemy army advanced and surrounded the fortress;  
Our fortress, Kav-tskhe, remained to guard Khadara and Dido.  
"We must remain to the enemy with wives and children, bear the shame on our necks!  
How could we wear armor again after that?!"  
Bakur turned into fire, only groans and cries...  
His heart turned into steel, his eyes sparkled.  
"Mother of the enemy!" – he said, and took his sword:  
"I will kill you again!" – and instantly beheaded his wife and children.  
He went to the fortress gate, and I followed him.  
With a raised sword, he laughed in a French manner:  
He killed twelve at the fortress gate, laying them on each other.  
The tiger's claws came out: and Bakur also fell asleep.
