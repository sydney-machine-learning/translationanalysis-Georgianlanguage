As once you did, o lady, as once you did, Cast me a glance, shew me your laugh.
You, at least, do not betray me, I shall die — weep for me then.
On top of a lofty mountain Dig for me a grave,
The sands of my motherland Cast upon me in profusion.
Already forgotten by the world, You too will soon forget me,
Soon you will find a fiancé, Whom tomorrow you will be marrying.
To these crags, at least, cry out These my last instructions:
Let them stand proud, bare of chest, Let them not admit any enemy!
Let them not start to fragment... Let the eagles rear their chicks,
Let them whirl around my grave, Very soon let them raise their call;
Let the mountains give joy to the flowers, On their necks let them carry the mists,
Though I’m dead, let them spread dew upon me, Then shall I be alive as before.
