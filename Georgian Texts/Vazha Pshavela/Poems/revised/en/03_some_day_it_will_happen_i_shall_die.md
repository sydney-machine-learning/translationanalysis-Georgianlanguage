Some say it will happen â€” I shall die, I shall be consigned to earth,
My heart and feelings I shall intermingle With the sands of my cold grave...
Frenzied worms Will wrap themselves about my heart,
No longer will my beautiful, lush-haired one Be able to succour me with her sobbing;
My friends the violets In vain will be indignant.
In vain will the stars Descend to earth from the sky.
A mourning-siren from the river will burst, Swiftly bounding from on high;
The fissure in the rock will break And embed itself in the gorge...
Alas! these I shall no longer be able to see Once into a corpse I have turned!
