I know not where to turn, To whom to tell my torment,
Conscience burnt in fire Who will pity, pray?!
Where have I offended, Lord, That you have set me as a cross upon mankind,
And my whispers You have laid upon men’s hearts as a tithe?
Men suffer, cannot bear me, Seek hurriedly to cast me out...
But many are those who, neglecting me, Have blackened their reputation.
I shall not leave men’s hearts alone, This is my eternal obligation,
I shall reveal absolutely all The faults residing there.
To one official I paid a visit, A receiver of bribes, a corruptor of the world;
He said to me: “Where do you think you’re coming, foul pest, I’m too busy for you today!...”
I answered thus: “Hold your tongue, You should be ashamed to rob the needy,
With no morsel to eat you sacrificed A mother of four small children!”
He rose and let fly a kick at me, Again and again he beat me:
“You rotten thing, how dare you Speak to me like that?!”
To how many others — who will count? — have I said: “How could you sell your mother?”
All to a man rained upon me kicks And the words: “How dare you say this?”
I beg you to remove me from the world, You, heavenly Father, who have no overlord.
