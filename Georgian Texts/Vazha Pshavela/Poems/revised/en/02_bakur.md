Tell us, Elizbar, In Egho what did occur.
How did the Dagestanis fall Upon Bak’ur’s fortress-home?
I do not want old sorrow Our hearts again to furrow.
Who am I to speak? It is for Bak’ur To vaunt his own valour...
The life of me and others The grave extinguishes.
That why say you, man? A kick upon yourself why land?
In truth this is all I want to say, Or should I boast while lying, pray?
I was unable to take his side, I could not give up — so sweet it seemed — my life...
Bak’ur’s skill in the fight You should have seen with your own eyes!
I’m pained at heart; alive, I ask, Why did I fall into the enemy’s grasp?
Because of this my present thoughts Well up inside my throat.
To lift my head I do not hasten, Nor seem I able my waist to straighten.
At least you didn’t flee — so why cry? They robbed you of the chance to die...
Why judge you as a cause for shame That in which there is no blame?
We too know, thus did we discover This news by some talk or other;
None censured you — by God’s grace — None talked of you in disgrace.
We entreat you, the news of the war To tell us now just as you saw.
A huge enemy-force descended And like a fence all round we were encircled.
For seven days with guns we kept it at bay, And many besides we managed to slay;
The women were measuring out our powder dry — In truth no praise for them’s too high! —
On day eight powder and shot dried up, Completely did they run out.
Our labour then and there We deemed to be in despair.
Without sleep, food or water — How we were then, one day the enemy will ponder! —
We were betrayed by cruel fate, Put under pressure, left isolate.
Ever forward advanced the enemy-station, Till it quite engulfed the fortress-foundation.
Finally there remained only our walled castle For Gud-Xadara and Dido tribes to grapple.
“Must we be left with women and children to the mercy of the foe, Must we this shame upon our necks bestow?!
Thereafter how could we ever hang again Our armour and weapons about our frame?”
Bak’ur turned to flame, From him just sighs and moans there came...
His heart turned to flint, His eyes took on a steely glint.
“A curse upon the mother of the foe!” he swore And across his sword his hand did draw.
Then saying: “Now see your fate!” His wife and child did instantly decapitate.
The enemy he went forth to meet at the castle-gate, I too followed after him in his wake.
He leapt at them, his sword a-brandishing, And his blade from France a laugh began a-flashing.
Twelve he slew at the castle-door, One was laid to rest, then on top one more.
At length the tiger’s claws were spent, And Bak’ur too to sleep he went.
