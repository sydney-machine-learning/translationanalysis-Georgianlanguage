I believe, I always have believed In the eternal life of the soul, The good, the lover of the world, Scarred by the fate of this same world.
I believe that, though the ashes of kind hearts Be scattered over the land by the wind, Yet in each of us there will burn Hotly a wish forlorn â€” 
To repress evil, and that this Will ever be a defence of the good, Help, succour and saviour Of the downtrodden and needy.
Nature does not totally extinguish a kind heart, She carries it along with her from the very dawn of time.
