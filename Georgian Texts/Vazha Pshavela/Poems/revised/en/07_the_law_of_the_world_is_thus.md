The law of the world is thus: We depart, others remain;
In place of the dead right soon Replacements come.
Life loves life, And that is why it established this as law:
Apparently it created death Itself just to restore.
For that reason the weak it loathes Just like some old clothes;
Since it loves the young, the new, With them may each year be adorned.
We shall perish — love, Our own, secreted in our heart,
We individually lose, and we suppose It to be a universal loss.
After death we are lost to love, Yet love remains alive as before,
It flits around like a butterfly, Agreeable, entirely good,
It has as its kingdom the beating of hearts, The arousing of passions it has as a parent.
It sets the hearts of the living beating again, Planting violets and roses within.
Because of love the buck cries, Because of love the deer flies,
Because of love the nightingale sings, And because of love the meadow greens,
Because of love Nature thrives — Down to the final fly...
In the sea a youth is drowned, Crazed for his own beloved.
Glory to the world’s creative force, How well it has framed its laws!
