What created me a human being? Why did I not come as rain,
That I might forever have been As a bead on the bosom of the clouds,
Or to benefit the earth As dew or ice-cold snow?
My master would not have abandoned me then Thus desolate and forlorn!
Into the very sky he would have snatched me up, He would have borne me along as his child.
I would not then have needed like this Always and ever to be on my guard.
Enamoured of the sun I might have journeyed, Putting death to shame.
On high the sky, below dry land I would have had at my command.
I could have rejoiced, mountain and valley When verdant I’d have seen,
Watered by my sweat, As well as flowers, inside and out.
I’d have thrust out my bosom, By night to moon, by day to sun.
I’d have given a taste of life’s sweet thrill To the surroundings all too mortal!
In a heart turned to snow Would have remained to me the fiery hope
That still my death Into life would be transformed
And embrace around the neck Mother Nature now renewed.
