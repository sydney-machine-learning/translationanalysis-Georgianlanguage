Yet again shall I see the spring, The violet with neck upstretched,
Death into life transforming, Its divine loveliness,
The mountain and valley greenness, Beautiful, all blossoming.
Yet again shall I see the sky thundering, Rain in place of snow cascading,
The soil replenishing, The rivers babbling,
Torment no-one any longer suffering Or the pangs of hunger feeling;
The victory of truth then being Hailed by eagles over the mountain;
I too shall echo the refrain, My heart no longer feeling pain.
Two days ago and yesterday too I met A snake trying to poison a violet,
Venom and poison spreading, And yet no harm inflicting.
Today I see the violet’s full mantle, Sweet of scent, all gentle.
I gaze upon and remark quite simply: “How exquisite it is, how lovely!”
Snakes on their bellies crawl, Choked by bitterness and gall.
Yet again in profusion shall I witness Roses and blooming violets,
The transformation to dust and ashes of those Who only yesterday were full of boasts;
I’ll see spreaders of venom and strife Destroyed and giving up their life;
Desirous of our death I shall spy Ravens no longer with the power to cry!
I’ll see life’s breeze a-blowing Upon these environs that are dying,
The light a thousand-fold intensify For the sun and moon up in the sky,
As their beneficence they generously bestow Upon our land oppressed down here below,
And we, the victims of harsh force, Will shed no bitter tears henceforth;
The sweet singing of the birds In every quarter will be heard.
The longed-for visage I’ll be viewing From the land of the dead arising,
At his side his sacrificial lambs standing, There too to his allegiance sworn,
Devoted youths With love beyond the norm,
Their bodies adorned with wounds, This the fate of our country’s faithful sons,
And angels setting wreathes Of laurel on the heads of our heroes.
