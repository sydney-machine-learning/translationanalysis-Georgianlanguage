Thrush, it’s the same song you sing You were singing one hundred years ago!
You neither curse nor mourn any man, Nor from any do you ask anything!
Whether dusk is drawing on or day is dawning, There you sit, sweetly crooning...
You resemble a babe lying in its cradle, All ready for sleep.
God you have already acknowledged to be your father And yourself His child!
But why should you complain? At what Should your mind be troubled?!
If you desire, you will live in the valley, If you desire, to the mountain you will journey.
You have no yearning in your heart, beautiful one, For conflicting thoughts and beliefs.
Hungry? You will not grieve But feed on what you’ve stored away.
You will pass away without ever once Fussing over the way you look.
Not for you the grief of grey hair That snows upon men’s heads.
Never once have you looked back Along the path at your own trail.
Not once will you ever say: “For what have I exhausted my youth?!”
You sing with heart at peace, Gently you place wing on wing.
You have never thanked The tree that provides your food,
For you view all as under obligation And consider them to be your servant.
You have never needed to ask Of God assistance,
Just as you gaze upon sheep in the meadow, You apparently view wolves even so!
Your calm, child-like temperament Has never been perturbed by a foe.
For a moment only lasts your anxiety Over hatred or over love.
No yoke of obligation Is set upon your neck;
Not a second’s thought have you given To either another’s or your own fate.
But what should bring weariness, I muse, to your heart and mind,
When you yourself are joy incarnate And know not what it is to be a slave?!
None can snatch from you your motherland, Nor can any take issue with you over hearth and home;
Were such to happen, you still Will sing and burst into laughter,
And at some isolated place In a branch you’ll have sleep’s grace.
A blanket of carefreeness Will blissfully you encompass.
Never have your tear-free eyes Been bathed in tears;
For twenty years no wounded heart Have you had to carry in your breast.
You will have no fancy When dead for resurrection —
For death you turn into life By implanting freedom of spirit.
You are ignorant of the sufferings of men, And of that for which we perish...
In many things I envy you but in many I cannot speak of you with praise.
