One day I too will die, vanish into the earth,
Mingle my heart and feelings with the cold grave sand...
Frenzied worms will swirl around my heart,
The weeping of my beautiful beloved will no longer help me,
My faithful friends will worry in vain.
In vain will the cold stars descend from the sky,
The river, rushing swiftly from the heights, will raise a mournful cry,
The crevice of the rock will collapse, the gorge will be filled...
Alas, I will no longer see them, having turned into a corpse.
