I will see spring again, fragrant with lilacs,
Transforming death into life, its divine beauty,
Green mountains and valleys, covered in flowers.
I will see the sky thunder, snow and rain pour,
As the earth comes alive, rivers overflow,
No one suffers anymore, and no one cries;
On the mountain, an eagle cries of truth's victory;
And I echo him, and my heart no longer aches.
Just yesterday, and the day before, I saw a serpent poisoning the lilac,
Spreading venom and bile, but it couldn't harm it.
Today I see the lilac whole, fragrant, tender,
I look at it and say the same: how beautiful, how lovely!
The serpent writhes on the ground, choked by malice and anger.
I will see again roses and lilacs blooming abundantly,
Those who boasted yesterday will become dust and ashes;
Sowers of poison and bile will disappear, turn into nothing,
Ravens, craving our death, will no longer croak!
Let the breath of life blow on the withering fields,
Let the light of the sun and moon multiply a thousandfold in the sky,
Let abundant mercy pour upon our oppressed land.
We, victims of violence, will no longer shed bitter tears,
Let the sweet singing of birds be heard everywhere.
I will see the desired face, resurrected from the dead,
Beside him his comrades, devoted friends,
Young men, ready for self-sacrifice, with ever-growing love;
Let wounds adorn the bodies of the faithful sons of the Motherland,
Let angels place laurel wreaths on the heroes.
