It's not courage to strengthen yourself, to be strong.
You would be called a man if you were good on your own.
I don't consider it courage to interfere and suppress others either.
You would be called a man if you defended the offended.
Tell me, who called it courage to pity the oppressors?
True courage is to fight for the oppressed.
It's not courage to be full, to sing and have fun,
To exalt yourself over others and be proud of it.
Don't envy anyone, always be generous and kind.
You would be called a man if you sang hungry and thirsty.
