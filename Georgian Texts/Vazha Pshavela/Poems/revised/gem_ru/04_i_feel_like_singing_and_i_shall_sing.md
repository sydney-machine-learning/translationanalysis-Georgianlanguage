I will sing and sing - three wounds afflict my heart:
The thought of the past torments me, the present holds no joy,
And no one has revealed the thoughts of the future to me!
Shrouded in mist, a star dimly glimmers,
I cannot take my eyes away, having once seen it.
By gazing at it intently, I have become pitiable.
A wound grows in my heart, suffocating and saddening my soul,
I do not desire death, though suffering reminds me of it,
And my existence in this state reminds me of poor Amirani.
The sword lies idle at his side, and rust faithfully gnaws at the iron;
Neither the sword comes to the hero, nor can he reach it himself.
The gnawed chain remains whole, he sees, until the next morning;
The fire of torment and sorrow burns the master and his dwelling:
The ray of the future soothes the hero's sighs and moans.
