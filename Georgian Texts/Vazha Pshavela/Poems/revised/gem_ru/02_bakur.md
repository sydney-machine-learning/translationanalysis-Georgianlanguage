– Tell us, Elizbarao, what happened in Egosi?
How did the Lezgins capture Bakur's fortress?
– I don't want old wounds to torment my heart again.
What can I say? Let Bakur himself tell of his valor...
May the lives of my loved ones rest in the damp earth.
– What are you saying, man, weren't you ready to die yourself?
– I can only speak the truth, why should I utter lies?
I could not bear the burden of his shoulders, I did not die - my soul weakened...
Oh, if only you had seen with your own eyes the battle and the fall of Bakur!
My heart breaks, why am I alive in the hands of the enemy -
From this thought, poison rises to my throat.
I don't want to raise my head, my back is bent.
– You didn't run, what can you do, they didn't let you die...
Why be ashamed if there is no shame in it?
We know, the rumor of this grief reached us;
No one condemned you, thank God, no one remembered you with an evil word.
Tell us yourself about the battle, how it all happened.
– A large enemy army came and surrounded us on all sides,
For seven days we fought back with guns, many of them were killed;
Even our doctor fought - his valor is worthy of praise!..
On the eighth day, gunpowder and bullets ran out, completely exhausted,
And then we considered our labor lost.
Sleepless, hungry, thirsty - that's how we were before the enemy!
Fate left us, we weakened, lost our way.
Closer and closer came the enemy detachment, surrounded the fortress;
Our fortress remained only in Gul-Khadaras and Dido.
"Are we really going to leave our wives and children to the enemy, take shame on ourselves?
How can we put on armor after that?!"
Bakur became furious, only groans and sobs...
His heart turned to stone, his eyes went out.
"Woe to the mother of the enemy!" - he said, and grabbed his sword:
"I'll kill you myself!" - and cut off the heads of his wife and children at the same moment.
He rushed to the gates of the fortress, I followed him.
He jumped out with a sword, the French laughed:
He killed twelve at the gates, put one on top of the other.
The tiger was deprived of its claws: and Bakur fell.
