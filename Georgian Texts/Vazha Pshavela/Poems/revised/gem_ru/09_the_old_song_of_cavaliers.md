For this our mother raised us, to swear to her our love,
To don our armor proudly and forever sharpen swords,
To strike fear in our neighbors, those cowardly, vile souls,
So we won't yield our homeland to enemies diverse and foreign.
We bid farewell to kin, to wives and children dear,
Chose death over life, and swore by blood, it's clear,
No foreigner shall dare to trample our homeland's right.
Will mother birth again heroes such as we,
Ready to burn for homeland like dry stumps, you see?
We die with peace, and our song rings out so clear:
"Let mother die, it matters not, if children stay with her,
And wings will grow on the army of our motherland so fair.
A good father's son is always feared by the foe,
Neither tomorrow nor the day after will they dare to strike a blow.
Victory belongs to those who hold life cheap,
We won't surrender our homeland alive, nor will we weep.
We chose death over life, and swore by blood, it's true,
Will mother birth again heroes such as we, anew?"
We won't give up our homeland, no one can tear us apart,
Or else a day will come when even the dead will laugh.
We won't surrender our homeland to strangers alive,
Nor poison it with the venom of betrayal, as we strive.
Like lions, we'll pounce on the enemy, to fall in the fight,
The enemy won't see our backs, believe me, they'll take flight!
Our battles and wars will become legends for our children's ears,
We won't give up our homeland, even if we pierce ourselves with spears.
We won't give up our native land to foreign hands,
Let mothers teach this lesson when they sing lullabies in all lands.
Will mother birth again heroes such as we, so grand?
