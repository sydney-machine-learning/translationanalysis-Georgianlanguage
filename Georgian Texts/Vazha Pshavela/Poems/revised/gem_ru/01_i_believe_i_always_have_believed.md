I believe, I have always believed in the eternal life of the soul, in goodness, in love for my homeland, in the pain of its fate.
I believe that even if the ashes of a kind heart are scattered by the wind across the earth, within it still burns a fiery desire,
For good, oppressed by evil, to always be a defender; for the poor and needy, a helper, deliverer, savior.
A kind heart is not killed by nature, it carries it with itself eternally!
