Again you, again, my girl, look at me, smile.
Don't betray me, or I will die - mourn for me.
Dig my grave on the top of a high mountain,
Scatter the sand of my homeland upon it frequently.
Forgotten by the village, you too will soon forget me,
Soon you will find a groom, tomorrow you will leave me.
Tell these cliffs everything I bequeathed to you:
Let them stand proudly, not letting the enemy through to me!
Let them not begin to crumble... Let eagles raise their young,
Let them return to my grave, let them often weep for me;
Let the mountains bloom with flowers, let their necks be adorned with mists,
Let dew fall on my dead heart - and I will live again.
