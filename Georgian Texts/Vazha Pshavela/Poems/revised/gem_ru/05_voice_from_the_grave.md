Sharpen your sword, brother, the enemy is descending from the mountain:
They are ravaging our land, they will fall upon us from above.
Sharpen, sharpen it so, that it catches on their hair.
May the blood of the enemy be spilled on the land of Gordy!
Here they come, the cursed ones, in formation, fearlessly along the road.
The gun thunders, smoke settles on smoke...
They are ravaging our land, making sisters weep for their brothers!..
Sharpen, sharpen it well, so it doesn't slip on the bone.
The Lord's blessing burns on the shield of the defender of the Motherland...
Kissed by Queen Tamar, it lies on the sword.
Be brave, brother, don't be afraid, why hesitate?
It is better to die once than to live in shame on earth!
My heart also breaks, but what can I do! I am just empty bones,
My strong arms are bound by earth,
My soul is with God - there, where the heavenly powers shine.
And the memory of my country is here, buried with me.
The image of my homeland is always before my eyes.
Iveria will not forget her little Kakhetian.
