Sing, thrush, sing the same song you sang a hundred years ago!
Curse no one, weep not, ask for nothing as your lot;
Whether it's dusk or dawn, you sit and sing sweetly...
You are like a baby in a cradle, ready for sleep...
You know God as your father, and yourself as his child!
What do you complain about? What does your soul grieve for?!
They drive you away - you will live in the valley, they drive you away - you will go to the mountains.
Don't grieve, my beauty, about different thoughts and worries.
Are you hungry? - Don't worry, you will be nourished by the sun.
You will die without ever looking at your own body.
You are not concerned about the gray hair that covers people's hair.
You have never looked back at your path, at your trail.
You will never say: "Why did I betray my youth?!"
You sing carefree, beating your wings like wings.
You have never thanked your nourishing tree,
Because you owe everything to it, you serve as a servant to your cause.
You never asked: "Help me" from God,
As a sheep looks at the field, so a wolf looks at you.
Your calm, childlike nature does not get angry at the enemy;
Your grief over love and hate is fleeting.
The yoke of duty does not lie on your shoulders.
You have never thought about either someone else's or your own fate.
I wonder what will tire your heart and mind,
When you are joy itself, you do not know slavery.
No one will take away your Motherland from you, no one will take away your home;
Even if this happens, you will still sing and laugh,
And somewhere in a secluded place you will fall asleep on a tree branch,
The blanket of carelessness will cover you.
Your tearless eyes have never been washed with tears,
You have not carried a wounded heart in your chest for twenty years.
You are not at all scared of the dead rising from the dead,
You turn death into life with your cheerful disposition.
You do not know human passions, nor why we suffer...
Many miss you, and many cannot praise you!
