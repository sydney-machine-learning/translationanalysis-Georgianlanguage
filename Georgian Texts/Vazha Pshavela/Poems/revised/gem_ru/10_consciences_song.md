I don't know where to go, who to tell of my torment,
A conscience burned by fire, who will pity it?!
What have I done, Lord, to be burdened with man,
And his insistent whisper following my heart as a tribute.
Man suffers, cannot cope, tries to cast me out...
But without me, many have tarnished their name, alas.
I won't leave the human heart, it's my earthly duty,
I'll expose to all what guilt lies within.
I visited a government official, a bribe-taker, a plunderer of the country,
He said to me: "Go away, wretch, I have no time for you today!"
I answered him: "Be silent, be ashamed, you pitiful thief,
You've brought to destitution a mother of four small children!"
He stood up, kicked me, struck me again and again:
"How dare you speak to me like that, insect?!"
How many others have I told, who can count, "How could you sell out your mother?!"
Everyone trampled me with their feet - how dare he?!
I pray to You, God, Father of orphans, watch over the land, oh Heaven!
