No longer visit me, eagle, don't perch on my head,
I no longer rejoice in a good falcon, nor rage at a bad one,
The enemy destroys my soul, tears my skin, stands as an executioner at my door.
My eagle is nowhere to be seen, to support me by the shoulders,
I have burned like a candle in my own flame,
Whether to cock the gun or grasp the sword's hilt.
I am good for nothing, completely weakened.
Come, eagle, where are you? I recognize you from afar by your voice,
As soon as I sense your arrival, I will transform in an instant;
Instantly I will leave the earth, ascend to the heavens.
I will play the panduri, then sing a song on the tar.
I will weep, then pray, then rage, spewing venom upon venom.
When the eagle is beside me, perched on my right shoulder -
I become a royal crown, seated on a king's throne!
Who dares to insult me? They greet me with reverence.
When the eagle flies away, I am worthless, less than the least.
Hide me, don't show me, don't make a mistake, throw me in a dungeon.
