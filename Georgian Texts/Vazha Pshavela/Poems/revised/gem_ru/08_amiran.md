In the rock, a man of immense stature is seen,
Silent sorrow boils in his chest, melting his heart.
An unfeeling chain wraps around his arms like a snake,
And a spiderweb covers his clouded eyes.
Ice and moss of black color cover his body,
He kneels, waiting for the chain to be broken.
His sword, thrust straight, rusts,
He longs for peace, cries like a woman.
This slave has forgotten about the people below and the heavens above,
No one remembers his slaying of demons and devils.
At the feet of the tormented one, a fox cub has grown,
This little creature has conceived something unusual.
Tirelessly it licks the chain with its tongue - it wants to break it,
So that the sufferer is freed, so that the evil blacksmiths are destroyed -
Those who forged the chain on the anvil to bind him,
Did not pity the righteous one, sent him as a prisoner to the mountains.
While the fox cub gnaws at the iron truth,
The evil blacksmith comes out, hammering on the anvil.
And the chain is whole again, to the sorrow of the slave.
When will this ungodly labor destroy the hero?!
When will Amirani rise, chained and armored,
So that the ice melts and his face becomes serious.
So that he takes his sword in his hands, looks at the valley,
So that the mountains and rocks rumble, so that he clears a path.
So that the earth trembles, the clouds smoke, jump black,
So that small twinkling stars sit on the mountains like an army.
So that somewhere the sea hears this news, desired by good people,
So that it plays sweet music, reaches out to the sky.
So that a cloud descends from there, frequent lightning and hail appear,
So that the righteous crusaders cry out: "Oh, what a great sorrow!"
So that the blacksmiths repent of their sins, break anvils and hammers,
So that they shed bitter tears on the remains of their weapons.
