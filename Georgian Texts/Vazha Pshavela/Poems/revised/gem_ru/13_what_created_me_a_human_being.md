Why did He create me as a human? Why couldn't I have been rain,
To always be among the clouds, a pearl in the sky's chest,
Falling to the earth as dew or cold snow?
My master wouldn't have tormented me so harshly and cruelly!
He would've taken me to the sky, carried me as His child.
Then I wouldn't have to always be so careful.
I would bask in the sun, softening my death;
The high sky, the low earth would be my share.
I would rejoice, seeing the mountains and valleys green,
Watered by my sweat, with flowers inside and out.
I would open my chest to the sun during the day, to the moon at night.
I would give life to the fading fields.
Turned into snow, hope would remain in my heart as fire,
That my death would turn back into life
And embrace the renewed nature all around.
