Such is the law of the village: we depart, others remain;
In place of the dead, soon others appear.
Life loves life, therefore it has established this rule;
Death is begotten by it, to feed itself.
Therefore it hates the powerless, like old clothing,
Because it loves the young, the new, to adorn the year with them.
We will die, our love, deposits in the heart,
We lose personally and think of the loss for the whole world.
We, the dead, lose love, it remains alive,
Flies like a butterfly, beautiful, good in everything,
A heartbeat has a kingdom, a surge of passion has a parent.
It beats again the hearts of the living, a violet swirls within it,
Because of this the deer cries, because of this the doe flies;
Because of this the nightingale sings, because of this the field turns green,
Because of this nature rejoices - the last little bug...
A young man drowns in the sea, the hand of his beloved.
Glory to the Creator of the world, how well he wrote this!..
