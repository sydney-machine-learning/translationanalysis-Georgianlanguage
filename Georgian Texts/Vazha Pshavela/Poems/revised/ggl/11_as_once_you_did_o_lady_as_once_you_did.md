You again woman Look at me, I laughed.
you still don't betray me I will die - I cried.
On the top of Magli mountain tell me the grave
The sand of my homeland You came to me often.
From the village to the forgotten You will forget me soon
You will find a groom soon. I will follow you back tomorrow.
At least I hit the rocks Credits are mine:
They stood proudly Shamaushvan is not an enemy!
Don't start tearing downâ€¦ Eagles raise chicks
take me back to my house Mal-Mal Maighon Bibin;
let the mountains rejoice with the flowers, carry the mists around their necks,
Dew on the heart of the dead man, I will be alive again.
