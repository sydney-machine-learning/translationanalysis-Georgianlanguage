I will die once I run to the ground,
Shaurev heart and feeling On the sand of Civis Samar...
They will hug my heart crazy worms
No one can help me with a receipt my beautiful hair
They worry for nothing My friends, Ian.
They will come down in vain I can fight the cold,
The river sounds a mournful cry, the high jumper was in a hurry,
a crack in the rock The flood will get stuck...
Wow, I can't see them anymore Turned into a dead man.
