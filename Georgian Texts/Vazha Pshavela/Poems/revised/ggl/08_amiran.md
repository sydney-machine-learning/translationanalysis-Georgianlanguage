Huge body The man looks like someone in the rock.
Heart melting bile It boils silently in his chest.
An insensitive chain for arms coils like a snake
And blue eyes The network is connected.
Ice is poured over the body and the moss is black,
standing kneeling Waiting chain breaker.
directly stored his sword rusts
need to rest She sheds tears like a woman.
He forgot this slave Down to man, up to heaven
They don't remember from him The battle of demons.
Laziness of the tortured Finnia is lying with her feet,
This tiny creature A foreign thing persisted.
He speaks restlessly Licks the chain - must be broken
to save himself from suffering, To cut off the filthy smiths,
who were crucified chain to bind him
did not pity the righteous They sent a prisoner to the mountains.
How long will it take? Finnia is ruled by iron.
The heart stone turns out to be a blacksmith, Racunso reports that he has been killed.
And the chain continues A slave to the slaughter of the heart.
You would like this ungodly suffering When will this hero be sacrificed?!
when will amiran get up wearing a chain bracelet
Let the ice melt And don't laugh.
hold the sword of the month, let the barada shine
Let the mountains and rocks be crushed, He was dying.
The earth moved, the clouds moved Fuoden, jump black,
Curly little stars Jarada is sitting on the mountains.
Somewhere the sea can feel the story, longing for good
play a sweet instrument Reach out to the sky.
They burned the cloud with moon, Fire and hail are common.
The true crusaders call out: "Wah, what a great plague!"
blacksmiths repent of sin, You who break the walls, the stones,
For the remains of weapons of the month You shed bitter tears.
