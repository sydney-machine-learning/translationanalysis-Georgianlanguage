He is not a boy If you are strong, be strong.
I would call you a boy then It is self-evident.
I don't think he's a boy either Whomever you interfere with, suffocate.
I would call you a boy then To poison someone else's remains.
tell me who you said you were a boy Have mercy on the oppressors?
Well, boyhood is To the oppressed.
It's not boyishness. sing to the drunkard, sing to him
Take care of others And we sweat because of it.
Don't let anyone miss you. Always boast and be proud.
I would call you a boy then Sing even when you are hungry and thirsty.
