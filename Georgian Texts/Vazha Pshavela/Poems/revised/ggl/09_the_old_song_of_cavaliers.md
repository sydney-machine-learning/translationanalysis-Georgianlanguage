That's why mother raised us Nanasa would tell us for him –
put armor on the body, always sharpen the knife
It is in the heart that we cast away fear He interfered with the neighbor.
Let's not insult the motherland Thousands of opponents.
ask for relatives to his wife, children and family;
We gave life to death And the mouth – covered with blood.
We cannot give him alive He betrayed his land to the enemy.
Another parent is raising Brave men with us?!
Life for the motherland We burn like straw
We leave with peace of mind And at the same time we sing this:
"If a parent dies, what's wrong, The children leave the father,
It will still have wings of this world.
The rule is that the son of the good father The enemy was also afraid.
No one will dare tomorrow and the next day Let force invade our home.
Everyone is overcome by Jesus, life Who does not throw away the straw.
We will not give up to anyone alive The parent land of Ghalasa.
Let us call death life And the mouth – covered with blood.
What if the parent raises it? Brave men with us!"
We will not take away anyone's homeland. Let us not be afraid,
Otherwise, we will throw something like this today. Even the dead will laugh.
We will not give the homeland to someone else with the head of our living;
You can't hold us back With the poison of dedication to him.
I'm drawn to you like an enemy Let us break out like lions.
The enemy cannot see our back. If you see us, you will like it!
Children will have a reward Our struggle and wars!
We will not give our homeland to the enemy. We will plunge a knife into the heart
We will not give it to a foreign tribe Betrayal of his estate.
let mothers teach again They will call their children Nanasa!
Another parent is raising Brave men with us?
