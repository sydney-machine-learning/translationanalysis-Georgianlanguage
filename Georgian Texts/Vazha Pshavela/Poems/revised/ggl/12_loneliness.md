The eagle didn't visit me anymore No more barking at my head
Not even a good hider I don't care anymore,
The enemy destroys my soul, shakes my skin, He stood on the door like a butcher.
no my eagle seems to support me on the shoulder,
wind like a lock I burned my head
or pull the trigger of the gun I put my hand on the sword.
I'm not good for anything anymore I'm very upset.
Come on, eagle, where are you? I know you from afar
when i feel you coming I will change in a second;
I'm leaving the earth I will move to the sky.
Sometimes I'll make a cake pop, Sometimes I will sing Tarzeda.
Sometimes I cry, sometimes I pray Sometimes anger, I pour poison on top of poison.
when the eagle accompanies me on Maz's right shoulder,
The king's crown I am sitting on the royal throne!
Who can insult me? Salam is dedicated to Zdazeda.
when the eagle leaves I am Chvar, a small Chvarzeda.
hide me don't show me Don't make a mistake, put me on the bench.
