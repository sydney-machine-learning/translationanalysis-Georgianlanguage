I believe, there are always lands eternal life of the soul, Good, country lover, Ulcer from the fate of the country.
I believe that ashes are the heart of a good person Let the wind scatter the land, It still burns in itself Tial-desire was hot, –
Evil oppressor, good There will always be a guard; Bechav, needy He helped me, helped me, saved me.
Nature does not kill a good heart Brings old things with him!
