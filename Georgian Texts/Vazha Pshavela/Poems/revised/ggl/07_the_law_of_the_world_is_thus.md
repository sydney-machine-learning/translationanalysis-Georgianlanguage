The rule of the village is as follows: We will go, others will stay;
Instead of the dead soon Others appear.
life loves life This is why I made the statute;
Death has occurred He had to feed himself.
because he hates the weak like old clothes
that he loves Norch, fresh, – May the year be more beautiful.
We will die, love To myself, to my heart,
We lose personally and think He was lost to the world.
dead we lose love he is still alive
flying like a kite everything was fine
has a royal heartbeat He is passionately worried about his parents.
The heart of the living still beats, Inside is a round rose,
the deer howls Roe deer flies with it;
The nightingale sings from him, The field is green next to you,
Nature delights in The last insect...
A young man dies in the sea. It is for its own sake.
Glory to the creator of the country, How well it is written!..
