What made me human? Why didn't I come when it was raining
To be always there A bead of a heart-chest with a cloud,
to throw on the ground Was it cold with snow or snow?
The owner did not kill me So ochrad and tivlada!
I was kidnapped in the sky I was accompanied by my daughter.
I wouldn't need it that way Always be careful.
I would walk in the sunshine I blushed to death;
Sky above, earth below I would have a fraction.
I would be happy, Mta-Barsa I never saw green
Watered with my own sweat Flowers inside, outside.
I would let go of my heart and chest The sun during the day, the moon at night.
I felt alive Are-Maresa is dying.
It is in the heart of the one who turned into snow I had hope as a fire,
That again my death He was running for his life
and renewed nature He would hug his neck and ears.
