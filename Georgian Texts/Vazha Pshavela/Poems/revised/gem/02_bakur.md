– Tell us, Elizbara, What happened at dawn?
How did the Leks fall In Bakuri's castle courtyard?
– I don't want to stir up old sorrows In my heart again.
What can I say? It's for men To lament Bakuri's fate...
The lives of my loved ones Are extinguished forever.
– Why say that, man, Why blame yourself?
– Only the truth I can speak. Should I lie instead?
I couldn't bear that burden, I couldn't die, my soul clung to life...
If only you had seen with your own eyes Bakuri's battle and fall!
My heart aches, why am I alive, Why did I fall into the enemy's hands?
These thoughts now rise Like poison in my throat.
I don't want to raise my head, Nor can I straighten my back.
– You didn't run, what can we do, Death didn't take you...
Why be ashamed of what Is not shameful?
We know, we heard The news from afar;
No one blamed you, thank God, No one spoke ill of you.
Tell us now, yourself, The story of the battle.
– A great enemy army came, Surrounded us like a fence,
For seven days we fought them with guns, And killed many of them too;
The women were making bullets for us, They deserve praise indeed!..
On the eighth day, the bullets Ran out, finished completely,
And our efforts then We considered lost.
Sleepless, hungry and thirsty, We were then against the enemy!
Fate turned against us, We were lost, we were scattered.
The enemy army came and came, Surrounded the castle's walls;
Our fortress remained With Gul-Khadara and Dido.
"We'll be left to the enemy with our wives and children, We'll carry the shame on our necks!
How can we wear armor After this?"
Bakuri became like fire, Only sighing and moaning...
His heart turned to stone, His eyes seemed like wells.
"Woe to the enemy's mother!" - he said, And his hand reached for his sword:
"I'll kill you again!" - and he cut off The heads of his wife and children.
He went to meet the enemy at the castle gate, And I followed in his footsteps.
He jumped out with sword raised, The Frenchman laughed, they say:
He killed twelve at the castle gate, Laid them one on top of the other.
The tiger lost its claws: Bakuri fell asleep too.
