Sing, nightingale, sing the same song As you sang a hundred years ago!
I neither curse nor mourn anyone, Nor ask anyone for anything;
Whether dusk falls or dawn breaks, You sit and sing sweetly...
You are like a baby, lying in a cradle, Ready for sleep...
You have recognized God as your father And yourself as his child!
Or why are you complaining? Your mood What has spoiled it?!
They drive you away - you will live in the valley, They drive you away - you will go to the mountain.
Your heart does not tire, beautiful one, Of thoughts and ideas about different things.
Are you hungry? - You don't care, You will feed on the sun.
You will die without ever Looking at your body.
You don't care about gray hair, That covers our hair like snow.
You have never looked once At the path of your footprints.
You will never say: "Why did I betray my youth?!"
You sang carefree, You flapped your wing with a wing.
You have never thanked Your nourishing tree,
Because you owe it to everyone, You serve as a servant of your own.
You have never asked: "Help me" You have never asked God,
As a sheep looks at a field, So you look at the wolf.
Your calm, childlike mood Is not disturbed by the enemy;
You have momentary sorrow About love and hate.
The yoke of duty Does not rest on your shoulders.
You have never thought Neither of others' nor of your own fate.
Or what will tire you, I think, heart and mind,
When you are joy itself, You have not tasted slavery.
No one can take away your homeland, Nor can they take away your home;
Even if this happens, you will still Sing, you will laugh,
And somewhere in a fallen place You will sleep on a branch of a tree,
The blanket of carelessness Will be spread over you beautifully.
Your tearless eyes never Have not been washed with tears,
A heart wounded for twenty years You have not carried it in your chest.
You do not believe at all In the resurrection of the dead from the dead,
You make death into life With the power of a cheerful spirit.
You don't know the passions of men, Nor why we are broken...
I miss you in many and in many I cannot praise you!
