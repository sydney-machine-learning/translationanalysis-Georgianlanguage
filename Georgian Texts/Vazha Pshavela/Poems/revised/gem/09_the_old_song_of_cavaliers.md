That's why our mother raised us, To say "Nana" to her -
To wear armor on our bodies, To always sharpen our blades,
To strike fear in the hearts Of the neighboring enemy.
Not to yield our homeland To the thousand-fold foe.
We bid farewell to relatives, Wife, children, and our own fields;
We pledged life to death And our mouths - to bloody oaths.
With our living heads, we won't allow The enemy to betray our land.
Will the motherland raise again Heroes like us?!
For the homeland, we burn our lives Like straw,
We die peacefully And even sing this:
"Let the mother die, it doesn't matter, The children remain for the fatherland,
There will still be wings For the army of this world.
A good father's son, it's a rule, The enemy fears his trail:
Tomorrow and the day after, no one will dare To invade our home by force.
He who does not value life like straw Conquers all.
We will not let anyone Betray our motherland.
We pledged life to death And our mouths -to bloody oaths.
Will the motherland raise again Heroes like us?!"
We won't let anyone take our homeland, No one will take it from us,
Otherwise, we'll wreak such havoc, Even the dead will laugh.
We won't give our homeland to others With our living heads;
You won't make us retreat With the poison of betrayal.
We'll lure the enemy, To perish like lions.
The enemy won't see our backs, You'd like it if you saw us!
Our children will have as tales Our battles and wars!
We won't give the enemy our homeland, We'll plunge knives into our hearts,
We won't let a foreign tribe Betray our fatherland.
Let mothers teach this, When they sing lullabies to their children!
Will the motherland raise again Heroes like us?
