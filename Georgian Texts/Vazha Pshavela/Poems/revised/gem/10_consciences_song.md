I don't know where to go, To whom to tell my suffering,
A soul burned in fire Whose pity should I seek?!
What have I done, Lord, That you have burdened me with man
And persistently whispered My heart is burdened with tribute.
Man suffers, he cannot finish, He tries to get rid of me quickly...
But without me the name Many have tarnished it.
I will not be removed from the heart of man, This is my eternal duty,
I will reveal to everyone, What is the fault in the heart of man.
I visited an official, A bribe-taker, a devourer of the country,
He told me: "Where are you coming, you scoundrel, I'm not free today!.."
I replied: "Shut up, You should be ashamed of the poor wretch,
You left without bread The mother of four small children!"
He stood up, kicked me under the feet, He hit me over and over again:
"To talk to me like that, You dare, you little thing?!"
How many others I told, who can count, "How did you sell your mother!.."
Everyone trampled me with their feet, - How dare you do that?! -
I beg you, Fatherless, the country You are the owner, heaven!
