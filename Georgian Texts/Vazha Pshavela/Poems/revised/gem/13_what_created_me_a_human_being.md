What made me human? Why didn't I come as rain,
To be forever A pearl in the heart of a cloud,
To be thrown down to earth As dew or cold snow?
The owner would not have sacrificed me So much sighing and weeping!
He would have taken me to heaven, He would have carried me as a child.
I wouldn't need this Always being careful.
I would walk as a lover of the sun To soften death;
Above the sky, below the earth I would have had it as my share.
I would rejoice, the mountains and fields When I would see them green,
Watered with my sweat, Flowers inside, outside.
I would open my heart To the sun during the day, to the moon at night.
I would make life feel To the dying fields.
Turned into snow, in my heart Hope would remain as fire,
That my death again Would turn into life
And the renewed nature Would wrap around its neck.
