In a vast rocky expanse, A man of immense stature appears,
Silent sorrow melts his heart, Boiling wordlessly in his chest.
Unfeeling chains on his arms, Coil like serpents,
And a spider's web of darkness Covers his eyes.
Ice and black moss Cling to his body,
He stands there kneeling, Awaiting the breaking of chains.
His sword rusts, Leaning against the wall,
He loathes rest, Weeping like a woman.
This slave has forgotten The earth below, the heavens above,
They no longer recall His slaying of demons and devils.
At the feet of the tormented giant, A small steed lies,
This tiny creature Has a strange determination.
Tirelessly, with its tongue, It licks the chain - it wants to break it,
To free the suffering one, To destroy the wicked blacksmiths,
Who forged the chain on the anvil To bind him,
They showed no mercy to the righteous, Sent him as a prisoner to the mountains.
Before the steed can break The iron shackles,
The heartless blacksmith emerges, Strikes the anvil with his hammer.
And the chain is whole again, To the slave's despair.
Oh, when will this ungodly torment End for this hero?!
When will Amirani rise, Clad in chainmail and armor,
Melt the ice And smile again.
Grasp his sword in hand, Gaze upon the plains,
Make the mountains and rocks tremble, As they follow his path.
The earth would shake, the clouds Would billow and leap darkly,
The twinkling stars Would gather on the mountains like armies.
Somewhere, the sea would sense the news, Longing for goodness,
Play a sweet melody, Reach its hand to the sky.
Clouds would descend from there, Fire and hail would burst forth,
The crucified righteous would cry: "Alas, what great sorrow!"
The blacksmiths would repent, Break their anvils and hammers,
Sprinkle bitter tears On the remnants of their weapons.
