I sing and will sing, Three wounds pain my heart:
The past's thoughts torment me, The present holds nothing,
And the future's thoughts No one has revealed to me!
Shrouded in mist, A star faintly twinkles,
I can't take my eyes off it, Having seen it once.
With persistent gazing, I became blameworthy.
A wound grows in my heart, It suffocates my soul, saddens me,
I don't desire death, Though suffering reminds me of it,
And my existence like this Reminds me of poor Amirani.
The sword is far away, the wolf Faithfully gnaws at the iron;
The sword doesn't reach the hero, Nor can he reach it.
The gnawed chain remains whole, He sees, on the next morning;
The fire of suffering and sorrow burns The master and his steed:
The beam of the future soothes The hero's sighs and moans.
