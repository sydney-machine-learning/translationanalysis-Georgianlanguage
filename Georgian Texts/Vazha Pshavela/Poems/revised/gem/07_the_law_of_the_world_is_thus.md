The way of the village is this: We depart, others remain;
In place of the dead, swiftly Others appear again.
Life loves life, That's why it set this rule;
Death was created For it to feed itself.
That's why it hates the weak, Like old clothes,
Because it loves the young, the new - To adorn its years with those.
We will perish, our love Personal, we hold dear,
We lose personally and think It's lost for the world entire.
We, the dead, lose love, It remains alive,
It flies like a butterfly, Eternal, good for all,
A heartbeat it has for a kingdom, Passion's surge it has for a parent.
It beats again in the hearts of the living, A violet weaver within,
From it the deer cries, Through it the gazelle flies;
From it the nightingale sings, Through it the field thrives,
From it nature rejoices - The last insect...
In the sea a young man drowns, A sacrifice for his beloved.
Glory to the creator of the world, How well it has been written!..
