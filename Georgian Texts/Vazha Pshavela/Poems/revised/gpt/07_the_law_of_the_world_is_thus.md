This is the way of the village: We go, others remain;  
Soon, in place of the dead, others appear.
Life loves life, thus it has established this order;  
It created death to marvel at itself.  
That's why it hates the weak, like old clothes,  
because it loves the young, the new, thus it adorns the year.  
We die, carrying our love deep in our hearts,  
we lose it personally and think we've lost it for the world.  
We, the dead, are lost to love, yet it remains alive,  
it flies like a butterfly, pleasing and good in every way,  
its kingdom is the beating heart, its parents are passion and emotion.  
It makes the hearts of the living beat, within it is a circle of violets and roses,  
the stag bellows because of it, the roe deer leaps because of it;  
the nightingale sings because of it, the field greens because of it,  
nature rejoices because of it â€” even the tiniest insect...  
The youth perishes in the sea, his hand reaches for his beloved.  
Glory to the creator of the world, who has written it so well!
