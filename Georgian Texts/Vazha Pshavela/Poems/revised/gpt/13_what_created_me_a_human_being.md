Why was I created as a human? Why didn't I come as rain,  
to always be a jewel in the heart of the clouds,  
to descend upon the earth  as dew or cold snow?  
My master would not abandon me so desolate and aimless!  
He would lift me up in the sky, carrying me like a child.  
I wouldn't have to always be so cautious.  
I would roam, a lover of the sun, defying death;  
the sky above, the earth below would be my realm.  
I would rejoice when I saw the mountains and valleys green,  
watered by my sweat, flowers inside and out.  
I would open my heart to the sun by day, to the moon by night.  
I would bring life to the dying surroundings.  
Even turned to snow, I would still have the fire of hope,  
that my death would turn into life again  
and embrace the renewed nature.
