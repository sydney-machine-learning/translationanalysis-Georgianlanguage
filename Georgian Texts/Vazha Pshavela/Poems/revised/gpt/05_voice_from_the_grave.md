Sharpen your sword, my friend, the enemy has crossed the mountain:  
they will ravage our land, they will fall upon us.  
Sharpen it, sharpen it well, so it cuts through hair.  
It is a blessing if Gorda again feels the enemy's blood on its edge!  
Here they come, the cursed ones in formation, fearlessly on the road.  
Soon, the guns will thunder, smoke will rise upon smoke...  
they will ravage our land, and make sisters weep for brothers!  
Sharpen it, sharpen it well, so it doesn't wear out on bones.  
The blessing of the Lord shines on the shield of the homeland's defender...  
The kiss of Queen Tamar is marked as a seal on the sword.  
Be brave, brother, do not tremble, why do you hesitate?  
It is better to die once than to live in darkness on earth!  
My heart urges me, what can I do! I am but empty bones,  
my arms are weak and bound by the earth,  
my soul is with God, â€“ where the celestial powers shine.  
The memory of my country is buried here with me.  
The image of my homeland always glitters before my eyes.  
Iberians will never forget your little Kakheti.
