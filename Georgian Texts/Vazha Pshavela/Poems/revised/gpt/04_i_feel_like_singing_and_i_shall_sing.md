I feel like singing and I sing, â€“ I bear three wounds on my heart:  
Thoughts of the past trouble me, in the present, there is nothing,  
and no one has brightened my thoughts of the future!  
Shrouded in mist, a faint star flickers,  
I cannot take my eyes off it, having seen it once.  
By persistently gazing at it I have become blameworthy.  
The wound in my heart grows, it suffocates and grieves my soul,  
I do not wish for death, though suffering reminds me of it,  
and my existence in this way reminds me of the wretched Amiran.  
The sword lies at his side, the loyal dog gnaws at the iron;  
neither does the sword come to the hero, nor can he reach it himself.  
The gnawed chain remains whole, he sees it the next morning;  
the fire of suffering and misery burns the master and his dog:  
the light of the future dispels the hero's sighs and groans.
