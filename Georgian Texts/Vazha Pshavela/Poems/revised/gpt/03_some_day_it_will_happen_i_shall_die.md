One day, I will die, I will lie down on the ground, –
My heart and feelings will be buried In the cold grave's sand…
My heart will be encircled By frenzied worms,
Nothing will help me anymore With my beautiful hair,
My dear ones will be disturbed In vain.
In vain will the stars Come down from the sky and sit,
The river will start tolling With a mourning bell swiftly,
The rock's crack will widen, The meadows will be trapped…
Alas, I will no longer see them Turned into a dead man.
