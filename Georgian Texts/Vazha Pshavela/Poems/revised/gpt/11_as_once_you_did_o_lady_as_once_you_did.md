Once again, you, woman, look at me, smile at me.  
At least you, don't betray me, if I die – mourn for me.  
On the peak of a high mountain dig my grave,  
and frequently cover me with the sands of my homeland.  
Forgotten by the village, you too will soon forget me,  
you'll quickly find a new groom, and follow him tomorrow.  
At least weep for these cliffs as they are my legacy:  
let them stand proud and firm, and not let the enemy intrude!  
Let them not start crumbling… Let the young eagles raise their chicks,  
let them return to my grave, often soaring around;  
let the mountains bloom with flowers, wear the clouds around their necks,  
let the dew dampen my chest, – and I will still be alive.
