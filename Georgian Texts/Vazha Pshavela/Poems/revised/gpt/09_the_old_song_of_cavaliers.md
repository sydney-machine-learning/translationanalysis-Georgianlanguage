Our mother raised us for this, she sang lullabies to us —  
to don armor on our bodies, to always sharpen our daggers,  
to strike fear in the hearts of boastful neighbors.  
To not let our homeland be trampled by myriad foes.  
We bid farewell to our kin, to our wives and our fields;  
we pledged life to death and our word — bathed in blood.  
We will not give the enemy betrayal of our land while alive.  
Will a mother raise again warriors like us?!
For the homeland, we burn life like straw,  
we die with calm hearts and sing this song:  
“Let the parent die, what of it, the children remain for the father,  
they will still have wings in this fleeting world.  
The children of a good father, by custom, even the enemy fears them;  
tomorrow and the day after, no one will dare to invade us with force.  
He conquers all, who does not treat life like straw.  
We will not let anyone betray our motherland.  
We pledged life to death and our word — bathed in blood.  
Will a mother raise again warriors like us!”
We will not take the homeland from anyone, let no one challenge us,  
or we will bring such a day upon them, that even the dead will laugh.  
We will not give our homeland to others while alive;  
we cannot be forced back with the poison of betrayal.  
We move toward the enemy, to perish like lions.  
Our enemy will not see our backs, you will like us if you see us!  
Our battles and wars will be legendary for our children!  
We will not give the homeland to the enemy, we will stab ourselves in the heart,  
we will not give the betrayal of our homeland to any foreign tribe.  
Let the mothers teach this when they sing lullabies to their children!  
Will a mother raise again warriors like us?
