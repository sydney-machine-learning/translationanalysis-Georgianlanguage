Thrush, sing the same song you sang a hundred years ago!  
You do not curse anyone, you do not cry, you ask for nothing in return;  
whether evening falls or dawn breaks, you sit and hum sweetly...  
You resemble a child lying in a cradle, prepared for sleep...  
You know God as your father and yourself as His child!  
Why would you complain? What would disturb your mood?!  
You desire to live in the valley, you desire to go to the mountains.  
Your heart does not ache, beautiful one, over different thoughts and ideas.  
Are you hungry? You do not worry, you nourish yourself on the sun.  
You will die without ever looking at your body.  
You do not worry about gray hair, that snows upon us humans.  
You never look back at the path behind you.  
You never say: "Why did I waste my youth?!"  
You have sung calmly, beating your wings in rhythm.  
You have never thanked the tree that feeds you,  
because you consider everyone in debt, and you see them as your servants.  
You have never asked: "Help me" to God,  
you watch the wolf in the field just as you watch the sheep.  
Your peaceful, childlike disposition has never been disturbed by an enemy;  
your sorrow over hatred and love is momentary.  
The yoke of duty has never rested on your neck.  
You have never thought about your or others' fate.  
What could tire you, I think, your heart and mind,  
when you are joy itself, and have never tasted slavery.  
No one can take your homeland, nor contest your home;  
even if this happens, you will still sing and laugh,  
and in some remote place, you will sleep on a tree branch,  
a blanket of carefreeness will cover you comfortably.  
Your tearless eyes have never been washed by tears,  
for twenty years, a wounded heart has not weighed down your chest.  
You have never wished to rise from the dead,  
you turn death into life with a carefree spirit.  
You do not know human passions, nor why we perish...  
Many long for you, and many cannot praise you enough!
