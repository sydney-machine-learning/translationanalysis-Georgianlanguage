It's not manliness, To boast if they make you strong.
I would call you a man, If you were good by nature.
It's not manliness, I think, To strangle someone you can overpower.
I would call you a man, If you would help the oppressed.
Tell me, who has called it manliness, To favor the oppressors?
True manliness is, To stand up for the downtrodden.
It's not manliness, To sing and rejoice when full,
To boast over others And cause trouble because of it.
To not let anyone else be a poet, To always boast and be loud.
I would call you a man, If you could sing even when hungry and thirsty.
