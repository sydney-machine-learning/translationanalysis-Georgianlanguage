I will see spring again, the violet standing tall,  
turning death into life, with its divine beauty,  
the green mountains and valleys, blooming, full of flowers.
I will see again, the sky thundering, rain falling instead of snow,  
making the earth fertile, the rivers flowing,  
no one suffering anymore, nor anyone hungry;  
the eagle proclaiming the victory of truth from the mountains;  
I will answer its call, my heart no longer aching.
The day before yesterday, and yesterday, I saw a snake poisoning the violet,  
spreading its venom and poison, but causing no harm.  
Today I see the violet intact, fragrant and delicate,  
I look at it and say the same: how beautiful, how lovely it is!  
The snake slithers with a bloated belly, choking on envy and anger.
I will see again, abundantly roses and violets blooming,  
those who were once dominant, turned to ashes and dust;  
the sowers of poison and venom destroyed, rendered insignificant,  
those wishing for our death, ravens no longer cawing!
Let the breeze of life blow through the dying surroundings,  
let the light of the sun and moon increase a thousandfold in the sky,  
bestowing abundant grace on this oppressed land of ours.  
We too, victims of oppression, will no longer shed bitter tears,  
the sweet song of birds heard in every corner.
I will see the beloved face, risen from the dead,  
surrounded by his devotees, sworn to his side,  
young men, dedicated with utmost devotion;  
their bodies adorned with wounds, loyal sons of the homeland,  
angels placing laurel wreaths upon the heroes.
