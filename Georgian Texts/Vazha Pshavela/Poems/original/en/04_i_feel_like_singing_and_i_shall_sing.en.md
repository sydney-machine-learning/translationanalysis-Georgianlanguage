I feel like singing and I shall sing —
Three sores pain my heart:
Thinking about the past upsets me,
In the present there is no meaning,
And my thoughts for the future
No-one has made them shine!
In mists it is wrapped,
Feebly does the star flicker,
No longer can I tear my eyes from it
Once having seen it.
By stubborn gazing at it
I have been turned into an object of reproach.
And in my heart an ulcer grows,
It confines my soul and saps my strength,
I have no desire of death,
Though my torment makes me think of that,
And this existence of mine
Reminds me of poor Amiran.
His sword lies at his side, and his dog
Faithfully gnaws at his iron chains;
Neither does the sword come near this hero
Nor can he himself reach over to it.
The gnawed-through chain is whole again,
He sees it so every morning;
The fire of torment and misery burn
Both master and his abode;
The ray of what’s to come dissipates
The hero’s sighs and groans.
