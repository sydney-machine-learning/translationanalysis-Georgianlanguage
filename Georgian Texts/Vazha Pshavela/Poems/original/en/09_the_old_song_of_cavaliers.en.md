For one thing only did our mother raise us,
This is why she would chant us our lullaby —
That we should don our armour,
Always be sharpening our blades,
So as to cast constant fear into the heart
Of our posturing neighbours.
Let us not allow our country to be trampled
By one thousand different rivals!
We have bidden farewell to kin,
To wife, to child and field;
To death we have promised our lives,
To a bathing in blood we have promised our faces.
As long as we live we shall not grant
To the foe the right to harvest our soil.
Will mothers ever again rear
Warriors to be our peers?!
For the motherland our lives
We shall consume in flames, like straw;
With hearts at peace we perish
While singing words like these:
“If mothers die, it matters not,
For sons remain to their fathers —
New wings will sprout upon
The army of this earthly existence;
It is the rule that the son of a good father
Will again inspire fear into the foe;
Tomorrow and two days hence none will dare
To invade our homes by force.
All succumb to him who life
Does not throw away like straw.
While we breathe, we concede to none
The right to harvest our native soil.
To death we have promised our lives,
To a bathing in blood we have promised our faces.
Will mothers ever again rear
Warriors to be our peers?!”
From no-one shall we snatch their homeland,
So let none dispute with us over ours,
Otherwise we shall bring upon them such a day
That even the dead will burst out laughing.
We’ll not give our land to another
As long as life remains to us —
You’ll never be able to make us retreat
With poison as the gift presented to it.
We shall be drawn towards the foe,
That we may burst forth like lions.
Of our backs no opponents will ever have sight —
Were you to see us, I trust it meets with your delight!
Our children will find the stuff of legend
In the battles and wars we wage!
Rather than betray our country to the foe
We’ll plunge a knife into our hearts.
To none of foreign stock will we grant
The right to harvest our native soil.
Let this be the lesson for all mothers
When they sing their children a lullaby!
Will mothers ever again rear
Warriors to be our peers?!
