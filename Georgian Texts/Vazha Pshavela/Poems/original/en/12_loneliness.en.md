The eagle has ceased to visit me,
No longer does it bark at me from above my head,
Now that a creature of goodness no longer enthuses me,
I no longer feel anger at the evil in the world;
The foe divests me of my soul and flays my skin,
As an executioner he stands at my door.
My eagle is nowhere to be seen
To beat its wings upon my shoulder
That I might flare up like a container of lime,
That I might burn over my own flame,
Or that I might pull the trigger of my gun
Or set my hand upon my sword.
I am no longer any good at anything,
Utter cowardice seems to be my lot.
Come back, o eagle, where have you gone?
From afar I recognise you by your call.
As soon as I sense your approach,
That instant shall I change for the better;
Immediately I’ll leave the earth behind,
I’ll take up residence in the sky.
Sometimes I’ll strum my panduri,
Sometimes I’ll sing to the accompaniment of a tari.
Sometimes I weep, sometimes I pray,
Sometimes I pour forth anger and venom upon venom.
When the eagle is by me,
It sits upon my right shoulder —
The kingly crown rests upon my head,
I am seated on the royal throne!
Who would dare to insult me then?
I am offered greeting on the point of battle.
When the eagle leaves me,
I am a limp rag, less substantial than a rag.
Hide me, do not reveal me,
Don’t make the mistake of setting me among an army of revellers.
