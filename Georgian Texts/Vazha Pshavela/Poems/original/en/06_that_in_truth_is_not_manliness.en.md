That in truth is not manliness
When someone eggs you on and makes you brash.
A man would I call you only if
Of your own inclination you shew your worth.
Nor to call it manliness would I wish
When you throttle the one you vanquish.
A man would I call you only when
One throttled by another you were to tend.
Tell me, who has styled it manly virtue
When it is oppressors that you nurture?
Rather is it true manliness
When you suffer for the oppressed.
And no manliness begins
When with full stomach you sing your hymns,
Or when you behave as superior to others,
And because of this despise us, your brothers,
When from your minstrelsy you give none peace
But ever vaunt and overheat.
A man then surely would I call you
Were you to sing in spite of thirst and hunger.
