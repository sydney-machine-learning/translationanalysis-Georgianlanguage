Sing to me and I will sing,
Three things bother me:
thinking about the past bothers me
Not in the present
And the thoughts of the future
Nobody hurt me!
shrouded in mists
The star twinkles a little,
I can't take my eyes off
I saw it once.
With his stubbornness
I will have to move.
And the ulcer grows in the heart,
It closes my soul, makes me tired,
they don't let me die
Although suffering reminds me of death
And my presence is like that
It reminds me of poor Amiran.
Put the sword aside, gosh too
He was faithful to the iron of Hghrhn;
Nor does the sword come to the hero,
Not everyone can reach it.
The worn chain is also whole,
He sees it, the next morning;
The fire of woe burns
To the owner and to the financier:
The ray of the future fades away
To hate and hate the hero.
