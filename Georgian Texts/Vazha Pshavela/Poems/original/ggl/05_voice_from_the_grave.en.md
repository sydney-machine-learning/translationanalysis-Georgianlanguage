Draw your sword, brother
The enemy came down from the mountain:
They will give us the country
They will hit us on the head.
Fuck it, fuck it
Let the hair hang over the mouth.
It is a grace to be worth it
The blood of Gorda's enemy was spilled!
The damned are coming
He was on the road in an orderly, fearless manner.
Alas, the gun jams
Smoke rises on top of smoke...
They will give us the country
Sister cries over brother!..
fuck, fuck well
Do not rub on the bone.
The Lord's blessing is kindled
The veil of the defender of the motherland...
Tamar-queen's kiss
It is worn as a ring on the sword.
Be strong, brother, don't be discouraged.
Do you hesitate about it?
Better to die once
Black presence in the country!
My heart also melts and what can I do!
I'm bare bones
I am tied to the ground
arms straining
The soul is with God, where
The celestial powers shine.
The memory belongs to my country
Here, it is with me.
It is always in front of my eyes
It is the face of my homeland.
Iverta will not forget
Your little kakhia.
