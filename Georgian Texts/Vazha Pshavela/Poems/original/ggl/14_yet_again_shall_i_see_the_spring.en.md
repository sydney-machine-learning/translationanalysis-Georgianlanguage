I will see spring again
yasa to the throat-singer,
turning death into life
to the god of that virtue,
on the green mountain-bar,
Sad, flowery.
I will see the sky again
Let the rain fall on the snow
freeze to the ground
let the rivers flow
No one should suffer anymore
and he is no longer hungry;
the victory of truth
They bought an eagle on the mountain;
I used to tell him
My heart doesn't hurt anymore.
I saw the day before yesterday, yesterday too
The snake poisoned Yasa.
Disturbed poison and water,
He couldn't even do damage.
Today I see that she is whole
fragrant, tender,
I look up and say the same thing:
What a turf, how beautiful!
The snake growls with its belly,
Bogh and anger are suffocating.
I will see it again
Fall, Ian Hvoden,
they were reduced to dust
Those who are yesterday's avalanche;
Sowers of poison and poison
They killed themselves, didn't they?
Those who want our death
Ravens can't fight anymore!
Let the breath of life blow
Are-Mares will die
Let the light shine
the sun and the moon in the sky,
Abundant grace
This is on the side of our oppressed.
We, victims of violence,
Let's not shed bitter tears
sweet singing of birds
Be heard on every side.
I will see a longing face
to rise from the dead
His cousins ​​stood by his side,
strikers side
Young, dedicated
more and more with trfial;
Ulcers adorn the body
To the faithful children of the land,
Angels on laurels
Crowning heroes.
