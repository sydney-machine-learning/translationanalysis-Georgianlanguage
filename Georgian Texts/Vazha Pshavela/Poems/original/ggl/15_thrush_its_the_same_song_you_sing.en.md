Shashvo, sing to him, whatever
Sing a hundred years ago!
I don't curse anyone, I don't care,
You don't ask for anyone's race;
sadness comes when it rains
You are smiling, sweetie...
You look like a baby, sleeping in a cradle,
He is sleeping when he is ready...
God knows you, Father
And he is the son of that!
Or what are you complaining about? mood
What did they spill yours on?!
They will take you away - you will live in a bar,
They will go to you - you will go to Mtazeda.
don't beat your heart, beautiful
Thinking and thinking about different things.
are you hungry - don't worry
Meals are ready.
You will die once
Don't look at Tanzeda.
you will not turn gray
Man, it will snow on our hair.
I haven't looked at you once
He followed his path.
Do not say once:
"Why did I get tired of being a boy?!"
sing softly
I beat you with a wing.
I never thanked you
like the tree of its nourishment,
Because you owe everyone
You look like a servant.
You didn't ask: "Help me"
you never
like a sheep in the field
I look at you like a wolf.
Calm, childlike mood
Don't mess with the enemy;
You are worried for a moment
about hate-love.
the yoke of duty
No, you're not standing.
You never thought about it
Neither on other people's, nor on one's own fate.
or what makes you tired
I think heart and mind
when you are joy itself
You have not tasted slavery.
No one will take away your homeland.
You will not be able to escape from house to house;
Even if this happens, at least you
you will sing, you will laugh
and to a random place
you will fall asleep on a tree branch
A carefree blanket
It will be good for you.
There are no tearless eyes
You haven't washed it with tears
Broken heart for twenty years
You are not attracted to breasts.
You don't like it at all
resurrection of the dead
You turn death into life
With a pleasant mood.
do not start the passion of men
Not even what we settle for...
I miss you in many ways
I can't praise you enough!
