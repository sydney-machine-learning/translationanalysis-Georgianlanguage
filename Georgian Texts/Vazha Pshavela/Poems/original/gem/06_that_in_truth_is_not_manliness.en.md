It's not manhood,
To be strong and brave.
I'd call you a man,
If you could stand on your own.
It's not manhood,
To oppress and strangle those you fight.
I'd call you a man,
If you could heal the wounds of others.
Tell me, who called it manhood,
To show mercy to oppressors?
True manhood,
Is to suffer for the oppressed.
It's not manhood,
To sing and feast while full.
To boast about yourself
And mock others for it.
Don't deny anyone the art of poetry,
Always lament and burn with passion.
I'd call you a man,
If you could sing even when hungry and thirsty.
