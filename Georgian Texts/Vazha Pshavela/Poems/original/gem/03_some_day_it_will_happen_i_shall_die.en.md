One day it will happen, I will die,
I will be entrusted to the earth, â€“
I will mix my heart and feelings
With the cold sand of the grave...
Around my heart will coil
Frenzied worms,
My beautiful hair
Will no longer be saved by tears,
My swift falcons
Will be troubled in vain.
In vain will descend
The cold stars in a row,
The river will raise a mournful cry,
Jumping high and fast,
The rock's crevice will collapse,
The meadow will be choked...
Alas, they will no longer see me,
Transformed into the dead.
