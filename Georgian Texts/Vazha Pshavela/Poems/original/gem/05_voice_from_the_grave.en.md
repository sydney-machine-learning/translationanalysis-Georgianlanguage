Sharpen your sword, my brother,
The enemy descends from the mountain:
They will ravage our land,
They will fall upon our heads.
Sharpen it, sharpen it so well,
That it cuts through hair.
May it be blessed to taste again
The enemy's blood on its blade!
Here they come, the cursed ones,
In formation, fearless on the road.
Soon, the gun will roar,
Smoke will settle upon smoke...
They will ravage our land,
Make sisters mourn their brothers!..
Sharpen it, sharpen it well,
Let it not slip on bone.
The Lord's blessing shines
On the defender's shield...
Queen Tamar's kiss
Is imprinted on the sword.
Be brave, brother, don't fear,
Why hesitate?
It's better to die once
Than to live in shame on this earth!
My heart yearns too, but what can I do!
I am but empty bones,
My strength-drained arms
Are bound by the earth,
My soul is with God, there, where
Heavenly powers shine.
But the memory of my country
Is buried here, with me.
The face of my homeland
Is always before my eyes.
The people of Iberia will not forget
Your little Kakheti.
