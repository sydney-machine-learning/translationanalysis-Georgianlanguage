The way of the village is this:
We go, others remain;
In place of the dead, quickly
Others appear.
Life loves life,
That's why it's made a rule;
It created death
To feed itself.
That's why it hates the weak,
Like old clothes,
Because it loves the young, the new,
To adorn its years with them.
We will die, loving
Our own, holding them dear,
We lose them personally and think
Of them as lost to the world.
We, the dead, are lost to love,
But it remains alive,
It flies, like a butterfly,
Everywhere, good in everything,
It has a royal heartbeat,
The surge of passion as its parent.
It makes the deer cry out,
It makes the gazelle fly;
It makes the nightingale sing,
It makes the fields green,
It makes nature rejoice -
It's the last insect...
A young man drowns in the sea,
Reaching for his beloved.
Glory to the creator of the world,
How well it's written!..
