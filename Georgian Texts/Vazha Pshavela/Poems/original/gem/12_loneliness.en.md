The eagle no longer visits me,
Nor does it perch upon my head,
Neither does it bring good tidings,
Nor do I rejoice in the meadow.
The enemy is taking my soul, tearing my skin,
He stands like an executioner at my door.
I don't see my eagle,
To give me a wing on my shoulder,
Like a candle, I have burned out,
Consumed by my own flame,
Or I would pull the trigger of the gun,
And put my hand on the sword.
I am no longer good for anything,
I am greatly weakened.
Come, eagle, where are you?
I recognize you from afar by your voice,
When I feel your arrival,
I will change instantly;
I will leave the earth in a moment,
I will dwell in the sky.
Sometimes I will play the panduri,
Sometimes I will sing on the tar.
Sometimes I cry, sometimes I pray,
Sometimes I pour anger, poison on poison.
When the eagle accompanies me,
On my right shoulder, -
I am crowned king,
I sit on the royal throne!
Who dares to insult me?
They salute me on the ladder.
When the eagle leaves me,
I am a sparrow, a small sparrow.
Hide me, don't show me,
Don't make a mistake, put me in a jar.
