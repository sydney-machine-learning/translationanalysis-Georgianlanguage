I will see spring again,
The lilac with its neck stretched out,
Turning death into life,
Its divine beauty,
The green mountains and fields,
Growing, flowering.
I will see again, the sky thunders,
Rain falls instead of snow,
It will wash the earth,
Rivers will flow,
No one will suffer anymore
And no one will be hungry;
The victory of truth
The eagle will scream on the mountain;
I will also tell him the news,
My heart will not hurt anymore.
The day before yesterday I saw, yesterday too,
A snake was poisoning the lilac,
It was spreading poison and bitterness,
But it could not harm it.
Today I see, the lilac is whole,
Fragrant, delicate,
I look at it and say the same thing:
How beautiful, how beautiful it is!
The snake crawls on its belly,
It is choked with anger and rage.
I will see again, abundantly
Roses, violets will bloom,
Those who were proud yesterday
Will be turned into ashes and dust;
The sowers of poison and bitterness
Will perish, they will be nothing,
Those who wished for our death
The ravens will not be able to croak anymore!
Let the breath of life blow
Over the dying fields,
Let the light be abundant
In the sky, the sun and the moon,
Let them give mercy abundantly
To this oppressed land of ours.
We, the victims of violence,
Let us not shed bitter tears anymore,
Let the sweet song of birds
Be heard in every corner.
I will see the longed-for face,
That would rise from the dead,
His heroes would stand by his side,
Sworn by his side,
Young men, dedicated
With more and more love;
Their bodies would be adorned with wounds
The faithful sons of the motherland,
Angels of laurel
Would crown the heroes.
