Why did our mother raise us?
To tell us stories of Nana (Queen Tamar)?
To don armor on our bodies,
To forever sharpen our blades,
So that we may strike fear into the hearts
Of the meddlesome neighbors?
So that we do not surrender our homeland
To the thousand-fold enemy?
We bid farewell to our kin,
To our wives, children, and our own fields;
We pledged our lives to death
And our lips to bloody oaths.
With our living heads, we will not allow
The enemy to betray our land.
Will the motherland raise more
Heroes like us?!
For the motherland, we burn our lives
Like chaff,
We perish in peace
And sing this song:
"Let the mother perish, what does it matter,
The children remain for the father,
The army of this world
Will still have wings.
The son of a good father, as is the rule,
Is feared even by the enemy:
Tomorrow and the day after, no one will dare
To forcefully invade our home.
He who does not value life like chaff
Will conquer all.
We will not surrender our motherland to anyone alive.
We pledged our lives to death
And our lips to bloody oaths.
Will the motherland raise more
Heroes like us!"
We will not give our homeland to anyone,
Let no one try to take it from us,
Or else we will unleash such a day,
That even the dead will laugh.
We will not give our homeland to another
With our living heads;
You cannot turn us back
With the poison of remorse.
We will draw close to the enemy
And perish like lions.
The enemy will not see our backs,
You will like it when you see us!
Our battles and wars will be legends
For our children!
We will not give our homeland to the enemy,
We will plunge a knife into our hearts,
We will not allow a foreign tribe
To betray our native land.
May mothers teach this,
When they tell their children stories of Nana!
Will the motherland raise more
Heroes like us?
