Again you, again, woman,
Look at me, smile at me.
At least you don't betray me,
I will die - mourn for me.
On the top of a high mountain
You would dig my grave,
The sand of my homeland
You would scatter it often.
Forgotten by the village
You will soon forget me too,
You will soon find a groom,
You will follow him tomorrow.
Weep to those rocks anyway
My messages:
Let them stand proudly,
Don't let the enemy in!
Don't let them start to collapse...
Let the eagles raise their chicks,
Let them return to my grave,
Let them often bring the chicks;
Let the mountains bloom flowers,
Let them carry the fog on their necks,
Let them sprinkle dew on my dead heart, -
I will be alive again.
