I believe, I've always believed 
In the eternal life of the soul, 
Of the good, the lover of the country, 
The one pained by the country's fate. 
I believe, even when the ashes 
Of a good heart are scattered by the wind, 
Within each one, a spark still ignites, 
A burning desire for warmth. 
To suppress evil, to protect the good, 
It will always be a guardian; 
For the poor, the troubled, 
A helper, a savior, a rescuer. 
Nature does not kill a good heart, 
It carries it along, from time immemorial!
