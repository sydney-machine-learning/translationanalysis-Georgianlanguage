That is not manhood,  
to stand firm only when supported.  
I would call you a man  
if you were strong on your own.
Nor do I think it’s manhood  
to oppress and strangle others.  
I would call you a man  
if you stood up for the oppressed.
Tell me, who has ever called it manhood  
to favor the oppressors?  
Well, true manhood is  
to defend the downtrodden.
It’s not manhood  
to sing and celebrate while full,  
to boast about yourself  
and quarrel with others because of it.
Nor is it manhood  
to take away others’ right to be a poet,  
to always boast and speak harshly.  
I would call you a man  
if you sang even when hungry and thirsty.
