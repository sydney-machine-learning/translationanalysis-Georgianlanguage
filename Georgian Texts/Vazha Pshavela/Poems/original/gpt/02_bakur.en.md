Tell us, Elizbar,  
what happened at Egho?  
How did the Lekians  
attack Bakur’s fortress yard?”  
“I don’t want the old sorrows  
to be stirred in my heart.  
What should I say? It’s manhood  
that Bakur should boast of…  
The lives of people like me  
are swept away by the grave.  
– Why do you say that, man,  
why do you lament yourself?  
– Only the truth is what I can say.  
Should I lie out of pride?  
I couldn’t bear his shoulder,  
I didn’t die – my soul remained sweet…  
Bakur’s war and actions  
I wish you had seen with your own eyes!  
It kills my heart, why did I  
fall into the enemy’s hands alive, –  
From this, my thoughts  
rise like poison in my throat.  
I don’t wish to lift my head,  
nor can I straighten my back.  
– Maybe it wasn’t meant to be, what can we do,  
they didn’t let you die…  
Why do you feel ashamed  
of something that isn’t shameful?  
We know too, we heard  
the story like rumor and wind;  
No one blamed you, thank God,  
no one mentioned you badly.  
It’s enough for us, tell us  
the story of the war now.  
– A large enemy army came,  
surrounded us like a fence,  
for seven days we fought with guns,  
we killed many too;  
The women prepared medicine for us, –  
they are truly worthy of praise!..  
On the eighth day, the ammunition  
ran out, completely finished  
and our efforts  
we considered lost.  
Sleepless, hungry, and thirsty, –  
we were to the enemy at that time!  
Fate betrayed us,  
we failed, we were cast out.  
The enemy’s army kept coming,  
surrounded the fortress;  
Our fortress held firm  
to the brave and the great.  
“Should we stay with our wives and children,  
and bear the shame on our necks?!  
How can we put on armor again  
after this?!”  
Bakur turned into fire,  
only sighs and moans…  
His heart turned to steel,  
his eyes like flint.  
“Woe to the mother of the enemy!” – he said,  
and put his hand on his sword:  
“I will kill you myself!” – and he  
cut off the heads of his wife and children instantly.  
He met the enemy at the fortress gate,  
I followed him closely.  
With his sword raised,  
he smiled French-style:  
He killed twelve at the fortress gate,  
laying them one upon another.  
The tiger’s claws grew tired:  
Bakur fell asleep too.
