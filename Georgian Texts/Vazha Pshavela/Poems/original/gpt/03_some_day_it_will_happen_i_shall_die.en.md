Once, I will die,  
I will return to the earth, –  
I will bury my heart and feelings  
in the cold grave’s sand...  
My heart will be encircled  
by frenzied worms,  
no one can help me anymore  
with their weeping, not even  
my beautiful, long-haired beloved,  
my dear ones will be agitated in vain.  
In vain will the swallows  
gather around.  
In vain will the stars from the sky  
descend upon the fields,  
the river will toll its mourning bell,  
leaping swiftly from the height,  
the crack in the cliff will widen,  
the meadow will be filled with it...  
Alas, I will not see them anymore,  
transformed into a dead body.
