I believe, I have always believed  
in the eternal life of the soul,  
of the good, the lover of the homeland,  
the one suffering from the fate of the country.  
I believe, that even if the ashes of a good heart  
are scattered by the wind,  
they will still ignite  
a burning desire within, â€”  
as the protector against evil, the good  
will always be a guardian;  
for the helpless, the downtrodden  
a helper, a supporter, a savior.  
Nature does not kill a good heart,  
it carries the wisdom of the ancients!
