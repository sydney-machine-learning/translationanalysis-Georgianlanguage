The eagle no longer visits me,  
no longer circles above me,  
neither does the good delight me,  
nor do I grieve over the bad,  
the enemy wears down my soul, flays me,  
stands at my door as an executioner.  
My eagle is nowhere to be seen,  
to lift me up on its wings,  
to blaze like a beacon,  
to burn in its own fire,  
or to pull the trigger of my gun,  
to put my hand on the sword.  
I am no longer good for anything,  
I have become very feeble.  
Come, eagle, where are you?  
I recognize you from afar by your call,  
when I feel your arrival,  
I change instantly;  
I immediately leave the earth,  
I migrate to the sky.  
Sometimes I strum the panduri,  
sometimes I sing to the tar.  
Sometimes I cry, sometimes I pray,  
sometimes I vent my anger, my poison.  
When the eagle is with me,  
perched on my right shoulder, –  
a king’s crown adorns my head,  
I sit on the royal throne!  
Who dares to insult me?  
They offer me greetings on bended knee.  
When the eagle leaves me,  
I am nothing, less than nothing.  
Hide me, do not reveal me,  
do not mistake me, do not place me on the throne.
