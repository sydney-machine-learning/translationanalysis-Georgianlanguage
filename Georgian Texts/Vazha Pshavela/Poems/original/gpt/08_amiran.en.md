In the rock appears a man  
of enormous stature,  
with heart-melting sorrow  
silently boiling in his chest.
An unfeeling chain coils  
around his arms like a serpent,  
and a spider's web  
is spread over his eyes.
Ice and black moss  
cover his body,  
he kneels there,  
waiting for the chains to break.
Standing straight,  
his sword rusts,  
he shuns rest,  
shedding tears like a woman.
This slave has forgotten  
the world below, the heavens above,  
none remember  
his slaying of demons and devils.
At the feet of the tortured one  
lies a loyal dog,  
this tiny creature  
with an unusual determination.
Ceaselessly licking the chain with its tongue,  
it tries to break it,  
to free the suffering man,  
to destroy the vile smiths  
who forged this chain  
to bind him,  
they showed no mercy to the righteous,  
sending him as a captive to the mountains.
Whenever the dog nearly breaks  
the iron chain,  
the heartless smith comes out,  
striking the anvil.
And the chain becomes whole again,  
to strangle the slave's heart.  
When will this godless torment  
end for this hero?!
When will Amiran rise,  
clad in chain armor,  
melting ice flows down his body  
and a smile on his face.
Holding his sword in hand,  
gazing at the fields,  
the mountains and rocks tremble,  
and they bow to him again.
The earth shakes, clouds  
drift and leap in darkness,  
the coquettish small stars  
sit on the mountains like an army.
Somewhere the sea senses the event,  
a sight for the good,  
plays a sweet lyre,  
raising its hand to the sky.
From there a cloud descends,  
a frequent hail of fire appears,  
the crucifiers of the righteous shout:  
“Alas, what a great calamity!”
The smiths repent their sins,  
breaking their anvils and hammers,  
on the remnants of their tools  
shedding bitter tears.
