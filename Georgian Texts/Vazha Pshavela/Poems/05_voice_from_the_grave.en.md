Sharpen your sword, little brother,
The enemy has taken up position on the mountain;
They will lay waste our land,
They will fall upon us.
Sharpen it, so sharpen it
That it suspend its blade on a hair.
If grace there be, the short sword will again
Be worthy of the enemy’s blood on its edge!
Here they come, the cursed ones,
In ranks, fearless along the road.
Very soon guns will thunder,
Smoke will settle on smoke...
They will devastate our land,
They will set sister crying over brother!...
Sharpen it, sharpen it well,
Let it not be blunted on bone.
The blessing of the Lord is lit
On the shield of the motherland’s defender...
The kiss of Queen Tamar
Is imprinted on his sword as a seal.
Be bold, brother, do not waver,
What, pray, makes you hesitate?
A sudden death is preferable
To a bleak existence on earth!
My heart too is surging, but what can I do?
I am just insubstantial bones,
By the earth I have my arms
Held firm, now bereft of strength,
My soul is with God — there, where
The heavenly powers shine.
But remembrance of my country
Lies buried right here beside me,
Constantly before my eyes is flashing
The image of my motherland.
Forgotten the Iberians will never be
By this your small citizen of K’axeti.
